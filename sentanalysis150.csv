Artificial intelligence could soon diagnose illness based on the sound of your voice | WKMS,allison longyael bensoussan md is part of the usf health department of otolaryngology head neck surgery she leading an effort to collect voice data that can be used to diagnose illnesses the national institutes of health is funding massive research project to collect voice data and develop an ai that could diagnose people based on their speech everything from your vocal cord vibrations to breathing patterns when you speak offers potential information about your health says laryngologist dr yael bensoussan the director of the university of south florida health voice center and leader on the study we asked experts well if you close your eyes when patient comes in just by listening to their voice can you have an idea of the diagnosis they have bensoussan says and that where we got all our information someone who speaks low and slowly might have parkinson disease slurring is sign of stroke scientists could even diagnose depression or cancer the team will start by collecting the voices of people with conditions in five areas neurological disorders voice disorders mood disorders respiratory disorders and pediatric disorders like autism and speech delays the project is part of the nih bridge to ai program which launched over year ago with more than 100 million in funding from the federal government with the goal of creating large scale health care databases for precision medicine this is the first time researchers have used ai to study human voices but it the first time data will be collected on this level the project is collaboration between usf cornell and 10 other institutions the ultimate goal is an app that could help bridge access to rural or underserved communities by helping general practitioners refer patients to specialists long term iphones or alexa could detect changes in your voice such as cough and advise you to seek medical attention to get there researchers have to start by amassing data since the ai can only get as good as the database it learning from by the end of the four years they hope to collect about 30 000 voices with data on other biomarkers like clinical data and genetic information to match let say you donate your voice to our project says yael bensoussan who does the voice belong to what are we allowed to do with it what are researchers allowed to do with it can it be commercialized while other health data can be separated from patient identity and used for research voices are often identifiable every institution has different rules on what can be shared and that opens all sorts of ethical and legal questions team of bioethicists will explore
UltraSight Receives CE Mark for Novel Cardiac AI Technology,at 30 am cdt updated hour agolandmark achievement paves the way for increased patient access to cardiac imaging and optimized care across europe in 2023barcelona spain prnewswire ultrasight an israeli based digital health pioneer transforming cardiac imaging through the power of artificial intelligence announced it has obtained ce mark for its ai guidance software for cardiac ultrasound today milestone comes just ahead of the european society of cardiology esc congress in barcelona and aligns with its call for action to achieve heart health in europe by 2025 ultrasight prnewswire ultrasight technology allows medical professionals regardless of their sonography experience to successfully capture diagnostic quality ultrasound images of the heart the technology can be used at the point of care paving the way for more widespread detection of cardiovascular diseases cvd and improved access to optimized cardiac care across the continent the novel ai software pairs with point of care ultrasound devices that are currently on the market and provides the operator with real time instructions on how to capture high quality diagnostic images the underlying ai neural network predicts the position of the ultrasound probe relative to the heart based on the ultrasound video stream only and guides the user on how to maneuver the probe to ensure that the acquired images are of diagnostic quality ultrasight was founded with the intention to apply the power of machine learning in imaging and put the ability to scan patients into the hands of physicians everywhere said davidi vortman ceo of ultrasight by empowering more medical professionals to accurately scan patients we will have faster and greater detection of cvd across the continent this is not only momentous occasion for ultrasight as company but it brings us one step closer to helping the millions of people in europe who suffer from cvd according to the esc1 there are 113 million people living with cvd in europe today europe has the highest cvd mortality rate in the world with approximately four million people succumbing to this disease each year cvd is the leading cause of death for europeans ultrasight obtained ce mark after results from clinical study held at the sheba medical center israel validated its technology and confirmed that the software is effective at instructing novice medical professionals to acquire diagnostic quality cardiac images the study found that ultrasight ai guidance allowed medical professionals who did not have prior sonography experience to obtain diagnostic quality cardiac images in 100 percent of patients the study was conducted using the philips lumify ultrasound device many medical residents have entered the healthcare field since the pandemic however being able to provide them with the necessary hands on training and supervision has become challenging for many european emergency departments looking to adopt point of care ultrasound said prof salvatore di somma md phd director of emergency medicine and chairman of the postgraduate school of emergency medicine at the department of medical surgery sciences and translational medicine university of sapienza in rome italy supporting new ultrasound users with ai guidance such as ultrasight ai guidance software would increase efficiencies and expedite the learning curve while also reducing the time for obtaining good echocardiographic imaging in the emergency room opening resources for experienced staff to respond to other acute needs point of care ultrasound can be very useful tool for intensive care unit physicians some key hemodynamic measurements such as left ventricular outflow tract velocity time integral lvot vti provide invaluable help to guide fluid therapy however some physicians are still reluctant to use it because they consider this measurement competence reserved for advanced ultrasound operators said professor bernard cholley icu department head at the pital europ en georges pompidou paris france when introduced to ultrasight ai guidance software we were very compelled by the prospect of ai supporting more healthcare providers including novice ultrasound users to acquire cardiac ultrasound view by which the lvot vti can be measured accurately for reliable measurement and optimized patient care the ultrasight ai guidance software is indicated for use in two dimensional transthoracic echocardiography 2d tte for adult patients it is intended to assist medical professionals in performing cardiac ultrasound scans ultrasight ai guidance software is an accessory to compatible general purpose diagnostic ultrasound systems and is intended to be used by medical professionals who have received

Mohammad Hosseini: Should we bring AI into hospitals? Let’s find the middle ground,recently two major news stories in the technology world broke out the first one was about call by big names in the technology sector to pause the development of artificial intelligence the second was about the use of large language models or llms in health care that followed recent interview with openai ceo sam altman who revealed that chatgpt and other applications based on llms will allow us to have medical advice for everybody some technology leaders are calling for pausing ai development altogether while another suggests that we should integrate ai into one of the most vital sectors of the society namely health care if this seems confusing it is because both ideas are radical and can be seen as the opposite ends of spectrum regarding technology but think we can find middle ground let take health care for instance pausing ai development completely would mean losing out on potential benefits that time strapped clinicians could use to improve care that said as an ethics expert can not ignore my responsibility to warn society about the risks and trade offs of hurried approach regarding the integration of llms in health care thanks to openai newly released gpt4 which can understand and analyze images in addition to text scans and rays could be among the collected health data so what is the middle ground whether we like it or not vital sectors including health care use technologies that collect our data while we are not even remotely prepared for the integration of llms in health care pausing their development is not the solution like other technologies llms will eventually be integrated into sectors like health care and so small scale experiments open up space for reflection and evaluation tthe middle ground involves cautious experimentation with small scale llms and evaluating their performance while observing what their developers will do with our information and trust instead of pausing ai we should collectively negotiate with ai developers demanding good faith and transparency to ensure that technology will not make us vulnerable in the future

structural level oppo made the decision to install the microlens module on the back cover of the phone rather than directly mounting it on the motherboard as the short focal length of the microlens requires the phone to be placed very close to the objects being photographed oppo also added new orbit light underneath the microlens to provide additional illumination to ensure the delivery of image versatility and high shooting performance bokeh flare portrait on oppo reno7 improves on the previous generation features to deliver more professional looking dslr like portraits oppo exclusive ai algorithms enhance the brightness of the human subject in images while automatically blurring the background and boosting the bokeh light spots with just one click oppo reno7 can capture portrait images with rich bokeh light spots that look just like those taken on high end dslr cameras compared to previous generation features the new bokeh flare portrait delivers more textured bokeh effect and enhances skin tones especially in images with high color saturation this helps portrait subjects to stand out more against backgrounds making them the clear focus of the image backlight can be one of the most difficult environments to master when taking photos but with oppo reno7 selfie hdr function and the imx709 sensor it now easier than ever to happily snap sharper brighter and more natural looking selfies in the presence of strong backlight although these stunning selfies appear instantly on the screen of oppo reno7 behind the scenes various complex algorithms are at work making sure that what the user sees is the best possible selfie image the hdr algorithm uses multi frame synthesis technology to suppress highlights and enhance dark details in the image alongside this portrait matting algorithm has been trained on large database of portrait images to accurately identify human subjects in the image following this the bokeh algorithm optimizes image segmentation to reduce false bokeh and ensure that edges between bokeh lights and the background appear natural further enhancements are then made to the shape and color of the bokeh flares and the brightness and tone of the subject skin oppo continues to explore how ai algorithms can be used to meet the different photo retouching needs for users around the world with ai beautification leveraging machine learning trained on 000 unique faces in 400 000 images ai beautification recognizes 393 key facial feature points to deliver natural beautification effects for portrait photos and videos on oppo reno7 rear and front cameras beautification effects include ai blemish removal and customized retouching for individuals in group photos ai beautification can accurately recognize and erase blemishes pimples acne scars and sunspots and intelligently retouch skin tones or makeup while keeping other desired features intact it can also intelligently identify information such as ethnicity gender and age to offer personalized retouching on the front camera skin textures and other facial features can be adjusted using the customizable beauty panel which offers 10 different settings and detailed retouching modes open to complete personalization making use of the oppo image clear engine ice embedded in oppo reno7 flash snapshot shoots multi frame bursts of ultra short exposure photos to capture crystal clear images even when subjects are moving simply raising the oppo reno7 and pressing the shutter is all that needed to capture any moment anywhere without worrying about blurry or out of focus images in addition the 64mp main camera provides amazing image processing capabilities the resolution enhancement algorithm can construct higher resolution images by utilizing sub pixel displacement between

Positive Technology And The Cosmic Mission: How AI Is Helping Humans Achieve States Of High Energy And Success,annie browncontributoropinions expressed by forbes contributors are their own aiannie brown is the founder of lips an ai enabled social commerce platform for women and lgbtq creators share to facebookshare to twittershare to linkedintrans humanism is not merely some geeky tech subculture nor futuristic daydream but pervasive phenomenon that is already impacting our humanness itself we re talking about the merging of human beings with technology and not just at the physical level but possibly merging that encroaches upon the most intimate dimensions of the soul and energy is the currency of the soul without it stressors can overwhelm you leaving self doubt and anxiety in control but by raising your field of energy you live an elevated life one of true transformation high achievement and success stefanie bruns the founder of business flow academy believes that states of high energy are paramount in finding fulfillment in life psychologist and business mentor for 16 years bruns has dedicated herself to helping successful people break through their self limitations and soar to new heights in business however with transhumanism comes potential risks to our mental health and therefore potential dampening of our vibrational frequency we have already seen this with the unintended negative impacts of screen time social media and more advancements have on our lives this is where positive technology comes in although many scientific efforts have been devoted to acknowledging the risks of digital technologies the question of how computers could be used to improve people well being has been much less explored this was the main motivation for the development of novel research area positive technology which aims at investigating how ict based applications and services can be used to foster positive growth of individuals groups and institutions positive technology or technology designed to improve the quality of our lives has boomed over the last few years now we have everything from happiness apps to physiological sensors that detect stress to digital objects that remind you to practice gratitude through discussion with bruns it became clear that while technology particularly artificial intelligence is often used to benefit mental health or business success separately by combining the two use cases people rely on their past experiences to dictate their future actions and give unlimited gravity to the words of others there are chains of the past and when you get free from the past you can create better future bruns explains everybody tells themselves story and it our duty to find out whether the story is useful or dysfunctional emotion regulation person ability to effectively manage and respond to an emotional experience is key aspect of psycho social functioning and well being how could digital tools be used to support this process study titled new technologies for the understanding assessment and intervention of emotion regulation addresses this discusses the potential of integrating technologies such as ai enabled virtual reality wearable biosensors smartphones and biofeedback for improving understanding assessment and intervention of emotion regulation every thought and every action has special electromagnetic energy if you tell yourself or others who you are every day you will become that person bruns says she believes that people in any stage of life can fall victim to this despite successful career and an abundance of wealth lack of guidance can be all that stands between you and greater states beyond high achievement this is why it is crucial for all business leaders to implement positive integration of human and technological support for example rocky ai is combining the strengths of virtual assistant and leadership coach and brings this together in soft skill training application which is available at all times in another example clinical research psychologist dr alison darcy created woebot facebook integrated computer program that aims to replicate conversations patient might have with his or her therapist woebot is chatbot that resembles an instant messaging service the digital health technology asks about your mood and thoughts listens to how you are feeling learns about you and offers evidence based cognitive behavior therapy cbt tools if psychology pertains to the connection between our emotions psychiatry explains their involvement in our biochemical processes our microbiome has significant involvement in the biomagnetic field of our body and every cell needs special voltage without the right level of energy our cells don have that voltage and fail to operate at their maximum potential the consequences manifest in all areas of our life from our emotional regulation and wellbeing to the manner in which we make decisions bruns believes in the importance of seeing our mind brain and energy field as one but many are unconsciously able to do so there are definite signs that machine learning algorithms and data can be utilized to effectively align these aspects of being in way that was previously left for us to do on our own in other words ai can speed up the process of energy and life enhancement ai in psychiatry is general term that implies the use of computerized techniques and algorithms for the diagnosis prevention and treatment of mental illnesses and could be applied similarly to enhance our lives for example current approaches for the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders largely rely on physician patient questionnaires that are most of the time inaccurate and ineffective in providing reliable assessment of symptoms bruns explains people are still making unhealthy divisions in their life often people repeat and reinforce negative outlooks and behaviors and justify them by saying it only thought but however intrusive or untrue it may be our thoughts still have electromagnetic voltage bruns explains every emotion has special vibration if you feel guilt and shame your vibrational energy is very low if you feel unconditional love it much higher but you can access these higher planes of emotional vibration if your body is not in good condition you can use antidepressants or wait idly for the problem to go away on its own you have to step deeper and heal from within to raise your field of energy then and only then will you follow the path of your joy and serve your cosmic mission music is an excellent example of not only the physical manifestations of vibrations but also evidence of how ai can impact our vibrational levels in the future studies now repeatedly show that music engages the brain at almost every level the term for these studies is now referred to as musical neuroscience or cognitive musicology it is this awareness amongst others that this article seeks to uncover including music healing qualities in one study researches used an artificial intelligence system to study the catalog of melodies produced by wide variety of different proteins they had the ai system introduce slight changes in the musical sequence or create completely new sequences and then translated the sounds back into proteins that correspond to the modified or newly designed versions now that we have uncovered the evolving potential of ai ability to impact our body and mind energy vibrations positively how can these be applied to create physical manifestations such as business success the path of your joy is unique to you and you only but in reaching the destination many have certain prerequisites in common fulfillment in one relationship an abundance of free time and thriving autonomous business it fact your professional success and your energy levels are intrinsically correlated bruns remarks of the phenomenon it makes huge difference to your market if you write copy in higher zone of your energy if your level of energy is high it infectious and people will want to be part of it they will choose you because it feels right however if you post because you feel you have an obligation to do so it will come from place of low energy your audience will feel that too she explains how does would heartmath institute use ai to capture and analyze data related to impact of their services and the energy thoughts electromagnetic impulses of clients alignment with one self is something that many people neglect but in the pursuit of an elevated life consider how you nourish your body in all forms emotionally mentally and nutritionally these small details eventually amount to much greater picture bruns discusses these concepts in her free training program crushing your energy identity code which delves into both the importance of hawkins scale of emotion and how it influences your life in lower stages of vibrancy as bruns explains after persistent burnout and frustration over lack of progress many people ask themselves whether they re even in the right field they wonder whether their true calling is in something else and consider making complete pivot however when faced with energetic incongruence changing your career path is merely an escape not solution bruns shares that everything starts with connection to your real purpose your cosmic mission what will be increasingly missing is human self awareness the inner life as the domain of aspiration wisdom conscience and what will increasingly disappear are the possibilities of true individuality creativity moral striving selfless sacrifice and transcendent awareness the cosmic mission is vision bigger than yourself when ask people what their biggest vision is often hear responses alluding to luxury bigger house nicer car or life in warmer country but ask them once again what your biggest vision then they understand their eyes light up your biggest vision and your ultimate driver is what you can do for others we are all on this earth to help in any way we can to help with something or somebody she explains bruns believes that if you are connected with your cosmic mission in way that enriches lives you ll jump out of bed every morning without wishing the day away the power of purpose filled life allows you to overcome trauma heighten your energy live joyful life and enrich the world we are energetic beings ancient cultures have held this truth far longer than any modern civilization and as energetic beings of light each and every cell has an electromagnetic field to keep in alignment as bruns observes this is not new knowledge this is old knowledge but we have new evidence experts have explored the effects of meditation on our human brain and there are remarkable differences in our synaptic activity before and after reaching heart congruence quantum computers are predicted to be capable of accomplishing things ordinary computers can not which reminds us of how our brains can achieve things that are still beyond artificial intelligence

vinogeoa layman guide to artificial intelligence ai august 20th 2018 851 reads0 vinogeovg according to the father of artificial intelligence john mccarthy it is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines especially intelligent computer programs basically artificial intelligence ai is the ability of machine or computer program to think and learn the concept of ai is based on the idea of building machines capable of thinking acting and learning like humans intelligent robots robots are able to perform the tasks given by human they have sensors to detect physical data from the real world such as light heat temperature movement sound bump and pressure they have efficient processors multiple sensors and huge memory to exhibit intelligence in addition they are capable of learning from their mistakes and they can adapt to the new environment chances are if you ve heard the term ai ballooning over the last few years you ve also heard machine learning as buzzword many have questions like is ai the same as machine learning not really although the two terms are often used interchangeably they are not the same artificial intelligence is broader concept while machine learning is the most common application of ai here what it means advanced machines use large data sets to learn and create patterns then they use what they ve learned to recognize more of the unknown ai and machine learning have similar relationship to rectangles and squares just as all squares are rectangles but not all rectangles are squares machine learning is one application of ai but ai is broader concept that has other uses too what ai like today ai has an intrinsic potential for bias in terms of the data used to train each algorithm to do what it supposed to for example google photos came under fire for tagging african american users as gorillas in 2015 and in 2017 the developers of faceapp beautified faces by lightening skin tones that why it vital for ai companies to look at the data they re using and make sure it engineered to reduce bias in light of this the smartest approach would be keeping an eye on how the technology evolves taking advantage of the improvements it brings to our lives and not getting too nervous at the thought of machine takeover 0by vg vinogeo read my storiesencode stream and manage videos with one simple platforml comments more

Building transparency and customer confidence in AI | TechRadar,are our bank accounts secure are our homes secure are our phone systems secure these are all questions we ask ourselves on daily basis and despite much wariness around the safety of technology when we are in need of help about delivery or service we without much question hand over personal details to chatbots about the authorryan lester senior director customer experience technologies at logmein chatbots have been designed to make our lives little easier with simple verification questions they can answer common customer service inquiries without the need to sit on hold waiting for an agent but with the rise of gdpr it is important for organisations to communicate to customers how the data that we provide artificial intelligence ai driven chatbots is being used and stored in this new era of chatbot technology and data regulations businesses need to put themselves under the same scrutiny that customer and regulators will transparency establishes trustas businesses continue to discover new uses for ai based technology the topic of ethics and transparency is becoming increasingly popular most organisations are using this technology to improve the user experience but for every ten examples of tech for good there will always be someone looking to exploit the technology for example using automated chatbots to gather personal customer data and then using it for purposes for which it wasn initially intended with this in mind it important that those who are using it for the right reasons are effectively communicating their ethical use of the technology in recent survey by capgemini research institute approximately three in five consumers who perceived their ai interactions with company to be ethical said that they place higher trust in that company were more likely to talk to others about the positive experience and are more loyal to that company by empowering customers and giving them the control and ability to seek recourse through the use of ai and chatbot technology businesses are more likely to see return trust from their customers it equally as important that businesses are communicating with employees about their use of ai and chatbot technology when the capgemini research institute surveyed employees they found that 44 have raised concerns about the potentially harmful use of ai systems and 42 objected to the misuse of personal information by ai systems in order to tackle and prevent issues cios and it decision makers should ensure they have clear code of conduct for ethical ai and that they are transparent about the use of ai in the business at the end of the day this technology is designed to be making employees lives easier is ai bias getting the better of us the growing use of ai for sensitive information including for hiring and healthcare has stirred great debate around bias and fairness yet human decision making in these and other domains can also be flawed shaped by individual and societal biases that are often unconscious although there are many cases where ai can reduce humans subjective interpretation of data we must remember that chatbots algorithms derive from public data including news articles and social media by using public data without checks and balances ai can incorporate the worst traits of humanity and end up embodying prejudices of the society several approaches to enforcing fairness constraints on ai models have emerged but we still have long way to go some of this work has focused on processes and methods such as data sheets for data sets and model cards for model reporting which create more transparency about the construction testing and intended uses of data sets and ai models other efforts have focused on the implementation of assessments and audits to check for fairness before systems are deployed and to review them on an ongoing basis all of these efforts should be accompanied by ongoing education campaigns to foster better understanding of the strict legal frameworks that accompany the use of ai and the growing availability of tools to improve fairness again transparency is essential when it comes to the use of ai and chatbots in customer facing services it vital that businesses understand the limits of ai and are able to communicate in simple terms that ai is not here to fully replace humans regardless of future developments ai will always lack the uniquely human trait of emotional intelligence therefore for every use of ai there will always be human operating the controls and customers should feel confident that this will not change be deliberate with technologyas ai and chatbot technology continues to evolve industries should prepare for the new challenges and criticisms that will inevitably come with it businesses shouldn be scared of this technology they should be embracing the innovative and exciting opportunities that it presents ai is technology that developing fast and it won wait for indecisiveness businesses need to ensure that they are being deliberate when they use it and transparent with how they use it if they can do this customers will place their trust in both you and your chatbot keep your passwords safe with the best password manager

of accelerated change and transformation this press release features multimedia view the full release here https www businesswire com news home 20220630005275 en graphic business wire ai is becoming huge driver of value to businesses and is set to contribute trillions to the global economy over the next decade said marshall choy svp product at sambanova progressive business leaders are realising the value of ai however benefiting from it requires technology teams to deliver this is where difficulty surfaces for most organisations in the financial sector the data from the study shows that over three quarters of finance technology leaders in the uk are already adopting ai models and algorithms however the study uncovered number of clear challenges from skills to technical that are facing banking leaders today top three uk enterprise challenges highlighted in the research include keeping pace with the speed of model and data growth 78 hiring staff with appropriate skills in ai ml 70 finding or customising models and algorithms 67 choy commented on the findings the research shows that financial services decision makers understand the value they can derive from ai today the rapid pace of innovation has presented challenges to technology teams in keeping up skills have become the limiting factor for ai implementation in bankingfor banking leaders ai is driver of business value and more than half 56 said that ai business impact will be transformational or significantly improve the business over the next 12 24 months for technology leaders in financial services finding skilled staff across all technology disciplines is difficult however the challenge is particularly acute in the specialist field of ai 52 of it managers reported that they have the budget to hire additional resources for their ai teams while 70 said that hiring the skilled staff is challenging over half 52 said that retention is challenge too you be hard pressed to find an area of technology that is being developed more intensely than ai especially around large language models such as gpt said chris kenny general manager emea at sambanova the opportunity these models deliver is there for the taking although technology teams often don have the resources or expertise to take advantage of the opportunity for enterprises struggling to deliver on business leaders demands deploying ai as service is fast track scalable way to avoid falling behind their competitors continued kenny ai is already here at most financial organisations notes to the editor the research surveyed 125 financial services enterprise leaders between about sambanova systems ai is here with sambanova customers are deploying the power of ai and deep learning in weeks rather than years to meet the demands of the ai

"Ready or Not, Here Comes AI | Next TV",why this matters after stops and starts artificial intelligence technologies now stand poised for major business breakthrough as emerging technologies go artificial intelligence ai has certainly taken its time in making its presence felt on the world surprising as that may be the term ai has actually been around for almost 70 years having been first coined back in 1955 by computer scientist john mccarthy the father of ai the same year emmett brown invented time travel in the movie back to the future since then ai has experienced largely stop start existence principally due to sporadic funding and below par technology in truth the term ai has arguably gained more notoriety for storylines of killer robots and the occasional wall hell bent on destroying mankind than for its practical use and business benefits but that all changing the fourth industrial revolutionthanks to breakthroughs in computing power the advent and availability of big data cloud hosting storage highly sophisticated software and complex algorithms the potential of ai is now starting to be fulfilled with the business world being the biggest benefactors the market has reacted at pace in recent years billions of dollars have been invested by many of if not all of the world leading organizations into ai technologies and companies each of them looking to utilize some form of ai technology to future proof and improve their businesses and or create competitive advantagevarious estimates suggest more than 46 billion will be spent on ai services by 2020 by businesses figure rising to above 51 billion 12 months later where ai will have the greatest and earliest impacte commercecustomer service including call centers healthcare including lifestyle automotivecybersecurityfinancelegalbut what is ai before we go on for the non computer scientists out there it perhaps worth clarifying few things around what ai is and is not yes ai can mean robotics but the best examples of ai are purely software based rather than having physical form there are hundreds maybe thousands of often extremely technical and confusing definitions banded around online and in various publications detailing what ai actually provides indeed entire books have been written detailing the subject for more technical and detailed description we recommend you visit your local library or download copy of one from the many ai authors out there nick bostrom superintelligence paths dangers strategies is personal favorite of mine in its most simple form ai is the study of methods for making computers behave intelligently and being able to replicate various characteristics of humans these can include identifying objects sounds understanding languages spoken reading and understanding content such as text and numbers machine learning ml is another extremely important branch of ai that you ll often hear and read about ml uses more cognitive approach using algorithms that enable it whatever form factor it may be to combine what it been programmed to do but also the capability of learning for itself through experience where we aredepending on what you have seen heard or read fictional or not you may have different ideas as to what ai is and is not capable of at this stage to offer some clarity there are three simple levels to be aware of weak aiai capable of demonstrating human intelligence to carry out specific tasks strong aiai capable of showing self awareness the ability to think and make decisions for itself to the same level as human being ai super intelligenceai showing superior levels of intelligence to human beings and fully in control of its existence for now and for the foreseeable future only weak ai is currently relevant so it time to remove any images of leathered up sunglasses wearing arnold schwarzenegger ai terminologies you need to knowalgorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve class of problems algorithms can perform calculation data processing and automated reasoning tasks chatbot also known as talkbot chatterbot bot im bot interactive agent or artificial conversational entity is computer program or an artificial intelligence which conducts conversation via auditory or textual methods such programs are often designed to convincingly simulate how human would behave as conversational partner deep learning also known as deep structured learning or hierarchical learning is part of broader family of machine learning methods based on learning data representations as opposed to task specific algorithms learning can be supervised semi supervised or unsupervised virtual assistant is software agent that can perform tasks or services for an individual sometimes the term chatbot is used to refer to virtual assistants generally or specifically those accessed by online chat or in some cases online chat programs that are for entertainment and not useful purposes machine learning is subset of artificial intelligence in the field of computer science that often uses statistical techniques to give computers the ability to learn progressively improve performance on specific task with data without being explicitly programmed robotics is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering and science that includes mechanical engineering electronics engineering computer science and others robotics deals with the design construction operation and use of robots as well as computer systems for their control sensory feedback and information processing speech recognition is the interdisciplinary sub field of computational linguistics that develops methodologies and technologies that enables the recognition and translation of spoken language into text by computers it is also known as automatic speech recognition asr computer speech recognition or speech to text stt it incorporates knowledge and research in the linguistics computer science and electrical engineering fields it already hereexamples of weak ai have widely been adopted by many different businesses and are in use today you just might not realize it in fact it fairly safe bet that you ve already unknowingly encountered some form of ai and machine learning technology before you started reading this article maybe even before you got out of bed have you ever used apple personal assistant siri or google alexa perhaps you ve noticed how your emails can often now detect questions being asked of you and automatically provide you with readymade short reply how about your smart phone that seems to be able to predict sentences you re about to type as you re typing for those that like bit of online shopping such as amazon or video streaming netflix have you ever wondered how those personalized recommendations are determined what about facebook and its ability to not only recognize there are people in the photo you ve posted but can sometimes even identify them too they re all using some form of ai with the intention of bettering their customer experience enhancing their financial opportunities and unseen externally improve their efficiency in workplace ai for all we are at the cusp of new revolution one that will ultimately transform every organization every industry and every public service across the world said ralph haupter president microsoft asia believe 2018 is the year that this will start to become mainstream to begin to impact many aspects of our lives in truly ubiquitous and meaningful way you may be forgiven for thinking the implementation of ai is something exclusively for the fortune 500 of this world but you be wrong today things are so advanced that there is unlimited growth potential with ai companies designed to support business like yours in essence ai is something that can be packaged up and purchased on monthly basis like your broadband or phone this model reduces significant costs associated with more bespoke in house solutions it also means the complexity is significantly removed the it doesn matter how it works as long as it works approach meaning you won necessarily need to go and employ qualified and expensive computer scientist you do need to be mathematics genius or have phd in software engineering to make sense of ai for your business said gartner analyst whit andrews you do have to make massive investments in infrastructure and personnel in order to start applying ai potentially transformative technologies these technologies will transform the nature of work and the workplace itself he added machines will be able to carry out more of the tasks done by humans complement the work that humans do and even perform some tasks that go beyond what humans can do as result some occupations will decline others will grow and many more will change competitive advantageso why should you and your business consider implementing ai could it be just fad will it really benefit you the answers are wide extremely varied and will be largely unique to your own business there may be some obvious areas of your business you like to improve upon be it financially or operationally motivated the magnitude and inevitability of ai can not be ignored nor underestimated many ai experts and professionals have described the potential impact of ai on businesses as being equivalent to the invention an adoption of the personal computer and email some suggest that ai can help boost revenues by around 20 percent while others warn that any business currently not at least thinking about adopting some form of ai could already be two years behind rival further delays could even result in their demise further down the road due to losing competitive advantage do or die more than one third of businesses will not survive the next 10 years said john chambers the now former ceo of cisco during discussion on ai companies should not miss the market transition or business model nor underestimate your competitor of the future not your competitor of the past ovum principle analyst michael azoff added every business should at minimum make itself aware of ai progress in its industry getting startedthe first thing to remember is what the purpose of ai actually is and identifying how it can benefit your business from speaking to various professionals in the field it can be narrowed down to two core reasons solving existing problems and discovering identifying new opportunities at its core ai is fueled by data which can come in many different forms for many different uses emails newsletters subscriptions views to your website downloads and sales are just some examples of where data can be collected on its own that data may not seem useful however contained within it could be the difference between success and failure or profit and loss this is where ai comes into play and where it would be able to in many instances do the job of human famous quote within ai circles comes from michael palmer of the association of national advertisers sums it up well data is just like crude oil it valuable but if unrefined it can not really be used it has to be changed into gas plastic chemicals etc to create valuable entity that drives profitable activity data must be broken down and analyzed for it to have value today the bulk of that potentially valuable data held in companies is still not being utilized if we look at the amount of data which is actually being analyzed today only 20 percent of the data we have is searchable and being used productively said ibm chairman president and ceo ginni rometty during discussion on the subject the other 80 percent is held inside companies generally not being used impact on jobsone of the more universal drivers for ai is centered around automation word often which spreads fear when discussing the risks to people professions areas like administrative work such as data processing and data collection are widely seen as function where ai will support or even replace humans ai and careersaccording to oxford university the following professions each have 99 percent probability of being replaced by computers in the future data entry keyerslibrary techniciansnew accounts clerksphotographic process workers and processing machine operatorstax preparerscargo and freight agentswatch repairersinsurance underwritersmathematical technicianssewers handtitle examiners abstractors and searcherstelemarketersmeanwhile the following professions are said to be widely safe from ai replacement recreational therapistsfirst line supervisors of mechanics installers and repairersemergency management directorsmental health and substance abuse social workersaudiologistsoccupational therapistsorthotists and prosthetistshealthcare social workerssome figures suggest almost half of all activities at work could eventually be automated while price waterhouse cooper estimates ai powered machines could take up to 30 percent of uk jobs by 2030 the bank of england has estimated that 15 million jobs may be at risk if your work is repetitive and not creative you will be gone very soon was stark warning dr roman yampolskiy professor in the department of computer engineering and computer science at the speed school of engineering university of louisville bart selman professor of computer science at cornell university was quoted as saying lot of large companies have middle management jobs where people manage other people at very low level in terms of keeping track of things like vacations and sick days those jobs believe are at risk jobs that involve large routine component if you ve made the proper investment you can develop an ai system that can take over good fraction of those jobs lot of big companies have lot of those positions and will be looking at it examples of automation and loss of jobs can be seen all over the world today some of the headline grabbing stories include that of japanese law firm fukoku mutual life which invested more than million building an ai platform with ibm watson has used the technology to replace more than 30 staff members the annual savings for the firm is predicted to be around million year the next wave of economic dislocation won come from overseas president barack obama said in 2017 during his farewell address it will come from the relentless pace of automation that makes many good middle class jobs obsolete spotting an opportunityanother major area for ai adoption is within sales there are now examples of where ai using natural language processing software and specific algorithms is able to spot patterns in data to identify new opportunities and provide level of analysis in just few seconds this can vary greatly examples include gaining greater knowledge on customer viewing and buying behavior what they re looking at and when they most likely buy such as pay day another might be identifying the best time to send bespoke marketing and promotional materials or newsletters to specific customers rather than en masse as part of one size fits all strategy another could be automatically identifying cold customers that haven transacted with you for while and send them updates reminders or special offers to help get things over the line the future of aithese are just handful of examples of how and where ai is already proving significant benefits and opportunities for businesses all over the world it important to realize these are all current technologies with this article designed to demonstrate and educate you as businessperson what is available today rather the stargazing into the future the ai revolution is here and it will if it doesn already play key role in the future of the way your business runs and performs when you decide to get on board is up to you ll leave you with this quote from gartner as vendors exploit ai software capabilities within business suites enterprise applications infrastructure support services and the customer experience your organization will need new or updated strategies ready or not ai is coming to you need to know more have burning question about artificial intelligence or maybe request for different

Microsoft and OpenAI Have a New A.I. Tool That Will Give Coding Suggestions to Software Developers – NBC Bay Area,github github parent company microsoft and openai have teamed up to deliver tool that comes up with source code for programmers to use as they work the system can make recommendations in almost any programming language although it works best with the popular javascript python and typescript languages openai will release the underlying online service for other companies to use this summer microsoft is looking to simplify the process of programming the area where the company got its start in 1975 that could keep programmers who already use the company tools satisfied and also attract new ones the system called github copilot draws on source code uploaded to code sharing service github which microsoft acquired in 2018 as well as other websites microsoft and github developed it with help from openai an ai research start up that microsoft backed in 2019 researchers at microsoft and other institutions have been trying to teach computers to write code for decades the concept has yet to go mainstream at times because programs to write programs have not been versatile enough the github copilot effort is notable attempt in the field relying as it does on large volume of code in many programming languages and vast azure cloud computing power nat friedman ceo of github describes github copilot as virtual version of what software creators call pair programmer that when two developers work side by side collaboratively on the same project the tool looks at existing code and comments in the current file and the location of the cursor and it offers up one or more lines to add as programmers accept or reject suggestions the model learns and becomes more sophisticated over time the new software makes coding faster friedman said in an interview last week hundreds of developers at github have been using the copilot feature all day while coding and the majority of them are accepting suggestions and not turning the feature off friedman said programming involves coming up with an idea about how to do something and then implementing it and github copilot is good at the second part said greg brockman co founder of openai and its chief technology officer it can save me from having to dive through whole bunch of documentation to get tool to do thing that know it capable of doing and that is so good for productivity he said ca even tell you the number of hours ve wasted trying to figure out the right way to do relatively prosaic thing just navigating the complexity of these tools github copilot will first appear in microsoft visual studio code free open source product and microsoft plans to incorporate it into the commercial visual studio product in the future this is the first time microsoft has leaned on openai to deliver smart software last month microsoft showed how it would update the power apps studio application which nontechnical people use to write apps so that users could type in words describing the elements they like to add and have gpt show options for the necessary code openai recognizes the potential for ai models to come up with code with gpt which it introduced last year the start up says on its website that an online service delivering gpt can handle code completion but back when openai was first training the model the start up had no intention of teaching it how to help code brockman said it was meant more as general purpose language model that could for instance generate articles fix incorrect grammar and translate from one language into another over the next few months people experimented with the model to see what it could do both useful and silly for instance one engineer made website that could design button that looked like watermelon brockman reached out to friedman as he was running key destination where millions of programmers work on code and things proceeded from there github employees have tried to ensure that github copilot will generate secure high quality code we ve built number of safety mechanisms into copilot that we think are cutting edge in terms of reducing the chances of mistakes in various areas here but they re definitely not perfect friedman said the underlying technology wo be only microsoft to use openai will release the codex model this summer for third party developers to weave into their own applications brockman said microsoft could someday release version of the product that enterprises could train to understand their programming styles scott said for now microsoft is only offering the service that knows about code stored in public repositories
"Riverside University Health System Medical Center, Skymount Medical Begin U.S. Clinical Trial for COVID-19 Oral Therapeutics Discovered Using Artificial Intelligence",first patient study in north america to investigate new combination of two previously fda approved drugs identified as effective against covid 19 by deepdrug an artificial intelligence platform developed by louisiana state university lsu researchers published prnewswire skymount medical has partnered with riverside university health system ruhs medical center to conduct the first clinical trial on the efficacy of covid 19 oral therapeutics discovered by lsu researchers using artificial intelligence ai the testing will be conducted through ruhs medical center comparative effectiveness clinical outcomes research center cecorc in moreno valley it will evaluate the combined effects of an already fda approved cancer medication and an already fda approved anti parasitic agent both approved for humans on patients with mild to moderate covid 19 symptoms that do not require hospitalization prnewsfoto skymount medical similar studies are already underway in europe although the outcomes for patients have yet to be revealed predictive studies leveraged by lsu ai technology and early cell and animal studies conducted by illinois institute of technology have already shown the new drug combination up to 97 effective in reducing the amount of sars cov the virus that causes covid 19 we re excited to partner with ruhs and dr bruce weng team to facilitate human clinical investigation to try to demonstrate the safety of the drug combination and efficacy in adult patients who have tested positive for covid 19 and exhibit mild to moderate symptoms said dr kishor wasan skymount medical chief medical scientific officer distinguished university scholar adjunct professor in the faculty of medicine at the university of british columbia and co inventor of the therapeutic combination the study will be double blind intervention conducted in an outpatient setting comparing the two drug combination to placebo the goal of the study is to determine the impact this combination therapy will have on decreasing the length and severity of symptoms without negative side effects the study will also evaluate if the combination drug can help decrease the need for hospitalizations the clinical research study has been ruled fda investigational new drug exempt fda ind exempt by the local institutional review board irb dr weng an infectious disease physician at ruhs medical center will inform patients diagnosed with covid 19 about the study and invite them to participate patients will be screened enrolled and have subsequent follow up visits in the ruhs emergency department unfortunately california has its fair share of covid 19 cases dr weng said the one silver lining in this is that the sample size at our hospital is substantial enough to produce valuable data when evaluating the safety and efficacy of this drug combination this is pilot study and 100 voluntary the safety of our patients is paramount and we will stay in constant contact with those choosing to participate to ensure their health and well being the researchers are hopeful that the new therapeutic also will prevent lingering symptoms which some people experience following covid 19 the drug combination may reduce long haul syndrome the long term consequences some patients report even after recovering from covid 19 such as mental health issues and damage to organs dr wasan said deepdrug the ai platform that helped discover the oral therapeutic was created by an interdisciplinary team of lsu researchers led by dr supratik mukhopadhyay associate professor in the lsu department of computer science deepdrug uses next generation ai capability that reduces the time and cost of drug discovery by up to 90 it very gratifying to see this medication enter into the human study phase dr mukhopadhyay said the fact that we are at this stage so quickly is due to skymount medical vast professional medical network and our deepdrug platform which was able to identify this particular combination of medications in fraction

What is artificial intelligence and how can it help your DevOps practices today? | TechRadar,by combining the roles of software development and it operations devops opens in new tab often encompasses so many tools and skills that too many of us get stuck working in complex and time consuming environment time that could be spent solving problems gets wasted on mundane tasks by using artificial intelligence ai devops can automate complicated tasks that are easy for computers but hard or boring for humans ai can also help streamline processes across the software development lifecycle sdlc allowing devops to focus on the work itself in this guide we cover how ai can be used throughout the devops cycle to improve productivity and security what is artificial intelligence ai is the theory and method of creating computer systems that can automatically perform tasks normally requiring human or greater levels of intelligence computers rely on complex algorithms to perform these tasks sometimes through explicit rules being provided to them but more commonly through what is known as machine learning ml ml is subset of ai where the system uses statistical methods to learn without explicit directions from human operator this requires sets of training data to teach the system desired outcomes from there ml can infer things about new data you may be using ai in your devops practices already for example tools that make automatic code suggestions when writing software the range and scope of devops tools available are growing and ai is predicted to be big part of automation in the coming year opens in new tab smarter automationusing automation to manage processes is vital part of the devops approach however without ai automation only executes actions based on explicit instructions provided by person ai uses broader ruleset and capacity to learn to improve performance over time this allows ai and most commonly ml to automatically perform complex tasks and eliminate the need for human intervention these tasks include requirements analysis natural language processing nlp is type of ml that understands the written word this ensures that the scope of project can be explicitly defined software testing ml can make sense of the data produced during regression functional and user acceptance testing it can even be used to automate the creation of tests in the first place this makes it easier to discover poorly written code and other issues automating critical part of the software development cycle problem solving ai can trace the root cause of problem while an overworked developer may fix an issue without investigating and solving deeper underlying problem security ai can be used to differentiate between normal and abnormal conditions this could include spotting unusual activity on network that may be indicative of unauthorized users gaining access to the network monitoring and alerts dealing with the noise of thousands of emails slack notifications and other alerts each day makes it easy to miss important issues ai can make the devops process less noisy by determining which alerts require human intervention and prioritizing issues accordingly this could entail raising the issue with the correct person automatically addressing the problem without human intervention or in cases where no action needs to be taken simply ignoring the notification in each of these cases ai is used to perform actions automatically that can reduce the workload of devops this is great in theory but how does it shape up in practice intelligent devops toolsthe most mature ai uses in devops are in applications that help programmers write code more effectively those which manage monitoring and alerting and those concerned with cybersecurity github copilot opens in new tab and amazon codewhisperer opens in new tab are ml powered tools that make relevant code suggestions to speed up programming both github and amazon integrate additional tools for testing within their environments not every notification is important and pagerduty opens in new tab is an incident response platform that uses ml to minimize interruptions by improving the signal to noise ratio of important events to routine ones as basic example instead of receiving alerts each time service has successfully shut down and restarted you might only receive an email if the service fails to restart pagerduty claims to provide up to 98 alert reduction both fortinet opens in new tab and perimeter 81 opens in new tab provide high performance network security tools that leverage ai fortinet provides resources for devops professionals including github repositories opens in new tab of tools and scripts to make setup and management of the software easier for those managing larger numbers of microservices or containers especially in multi cloud or hybrid cloud environment dynatrace opens in new tab uses ai to map simplify and manage the devops processes and delivery pipeline if you re interested in adding ai to your devops workflow you probably already recognize many of the best devops tools opens in new tab available many of the tools that you already use are either adopting ai or some such as selenium opens in new tab have additional software opens in new tab or plugins opens in new tab that allow ai to be integrated into them keeping on top of developments with the software you already use and searching for tools that integrate with them is great way to get started with ai conclusionthe devops culture has become an integral part of software development precisely because it allows projects to scale easily spinning up 000 web servers is now as simple as creating one artificial intelligence takes the process one step further allowing ever more complicated tasks to be left under the control of computer systems that learn and improve by using tools such as github copilot fortinet and pagerduty devops professionals can harness the power of ai to produce more efficient and secure sdlc while there are many myths around devops opens in new tab trends there is no doubt ai will continue to transform devops practices over the next couple of years techradar created this content as part of paid partnership with pagerduty the contents of this article are entirely independent and solely reflect the editorial opinion of techradar most

Escaping the Singularity: Why Artificial Intelligence Will Not Save the Planet | Yemen Watch,artificial intelligence has been touted as the next frontier in technological innovation by the world brightest minds and celebrity ceos like elon musk who predict hyper connected future where big data smart infrastructure and biology all fuse into what futurist ray kurzweil and others call the technological singularity in his 1999 breakout best seller titled the age of spiritual machines kurzweil takes the concept first developed by mathematician vernor vinge about the merger of technology and human intelligence to an absurd conclusion based on superficial understanding of mankind spiritual nature in which machines achieve consciousness and co exist side by side with living organisms in bleak universe bereft of any connection to natural reality as we move into the second decade of the twenty first century the ideas kurzweil brought into the mainstream are being aggressively pursued by big tech outfits like google which currently employs the author as director of engineering and have been enthusiastically embraced by important sectors of the global economy reflecting this trend the national artificial intelligence initiative act naiia became law on the first day of 2021 officially bringing the full power of the government to bear through the national science foundation nsf national institute of standards and technology nist and the department of energy whose already considerable spending on ai research and development has now been codified into law the passage of the bill follows pattern begun in the reagan years when the republican icon signed national security decision directive nsdd 145 making intellectual property matter of national security effectively opening backdoor to america largest corporations like ibm and pfizer to shield their commercial interests behind the full might of the federal government the naiia is continuation of the undeniable symbiosis between government and corporate america who are together leading us into kurzweil ai dystopia cloaked behind pseudo environmental marketing devices like the green economy or sustainable development on the commercial end and tired concepts of technological primacy vis vis china on the geopolitical end but scientists and researchers are finding out the true cost ai will have on the planet belying the claims made by the captains of industry and owners of capital who are moving full steam ahead in their campaign to implement an ai driven socio economic paradigm which is at once designed to rid them of troublesome and expensive human labor while at the same time rescuing mortally wounded capitalist system among their findings the researchers calculated that at the pace ai is being trained across industries co2 emissions from this activity would equal five times the lifetime emissions of an average car or 626 000 pounds of carbon dioxide experts are warning that the risks to the environment as result of ai and related emergent technologies such as the internet of things iot and machine learning systems are simply not worth it roy schwartz of the allen institute for artificial intelligence characterized the conclusions of the as shocking and stated that the larger you make these models the more energy they consume cautioning that if we continue on this trajectory we will see much more significant negative impact on the environment schwartz stresses that such massive energy consumption doesn stop at the stage of ai training and that it is practically impossible to quantify how much energy will be consumed across the world by ai models running in different countries and urged better use of data to substantially reduce energy consumption brilliantly covered for years by independent journalist cory morningstar and others the ruse undertaken by the world most powerful corporations and their interlocking interests through international organisms like the world economic forum is becoming increasingly clear the explosive growth of the technology sector and all of its gadgets in tandem with the illusion of achieving technological singularity through digitally interconnected planet only pushes us further into ecological catastrophe true renewable energy paradigm and reduction in co2 emissions can not come through an economic paradigm predicated on consumption and waste it requires culture of conservation and localized subsistence which the proponents of the singularity have no intention of abiding as more details of the apparent conspiracy headed by president donald trump to storm the capitol building and prevent the electoral college certification as more details of the apparent conspiracy headed by president donald trump to storm the capitol building and prevent the electoral college certification artificial intelligence has been touted as the next frontier in technological innovation by the world brightest minds and celebrity ceos like elon musk who
Three issues with generative AI still need to be solved | Computerworld,disclosure qualcomm and microsoft are clients of the author generative ai is spreading like virus across the tech landscape it gone from being virtually unheard year ago to being one of if not the top trending technology today as with any technology there are issues that tend to surface with rapid growth and generative ai is no exception expect three main problems to emerge before the end of the year that few people are talking about today the critical need for hybrid solutiongenerative ai uses massive language models it processor intensive and it rapidly becoming as ubiquitous as browsers this is problem because existing centralized datacenters aren structured to handle this kind of load they are constrained processor constrained database constrained cost constrained and size constrained making massive increase in centralized capacity unlikely in the near term even though the need for this capacity is going vertical these capacity problems will increase latency reduce reliability and over time could throttle performance and reduce customer satisfaction with the result the need is for more of more hybrid approach where the ai components necessary for speed are retained locally on devices while the majority of the data resides centrally to reduce datacenter loads and decrease latency without hybrid solution where smartphones and laptops can do much of the work use of the technology is likely to stall as satisfaction falls particularly in areas such as gaming translation and conversations where latency will be most annoying with translation this will be especially problematic because the way translations are done will always introduce some latency if the ai system adds more it is could make the related tool unusable qualcomm has released performance report that looks particularly troubling in this regard but it is likely only the tip of nasty performance problem to come the problem of securitythe language models generative ai uses include information that has not been fully vetted just this week elon musk threatened to sue microsoft for its use of twitter to train its generative ai model given that twitter data comes from its customers and wasn created by twitter the lawsuit is likely to fail on its merits that is if musk ever files the suit to begin with his history is longer on threats than actions it still highlights growing concern about who owns the results ai tools generate you can derive lot by successfully analyzing readily available information was competitive analyst for time and it was amazing how much we could find out about competitor activities using publicly available information but that research was all done by hand using comparatively little data these new ai models can pull petabytes of data now and will quickly grow to use exabytes and even zetabytes in the future the ability of these tools to uncover secrets from businesses governments and individuals will be unprecedented and the security technology needed to mitigate the problem not only doesn exist today it may also be impossible to create worse for some is that these tools can analyze data after the fact often decades after the fact surfacing things that were thought to be safely buried relationship trouble generative ai tools can interact with others on our behalf and present very different personality than our own the tools can recreate our image voices and even our unique mannerisms while acting as proxies was once an actor one of the problems actors have is that others tend to conflate an actor with role that has little to do with who they really are in relationships your significant other might well be in love with character you play not the person you are with generative ai this will be problem at scale as we increasingly allow these tools to interact with co workers and maybe even interact on our behalf on dating sites the disconnects between who people think you are based on an ai proxy and who you really are could damage trust and make lasting relationships both personal and career problematic we often go through lot of trouble when building relationship to hide our faults ai tools could make that even easier as result we may find it nearly impossible to trust those around us despite these issues generative ai has the potential to massively improve productivity act as proxies provide near instant translation and deliver answers to questions that have been unanswered but the issues with latency security and trust are real and they come in addition to fears about job losses that have been hanging over the technology since it arrived not arguing against generative ai doubt we could stop its advance even if we wanted to but we have to begin thinking about how to deal with these before the damage is becomes unmanageable

with approximately 39 of global co2 emissions one of the key reasons for this is that today hvac in buildings is controlled by set schedules regardless of actual occupancy in room resulting in long periods of heating cooling and ventilating empty spaces instead nomad go climatetech enables dynamic hvac control based on live occupancy effectively heating cooling and ventilating spaces only when they are occupied working with customers and leaders in the hvac industry nomad go has saved energy usage and reduced greenhouse gas emissions in real world deployments these include greystar real

buildings impact on climate change initial research https www pnnl gov main publications external technical reports pnnl 22072 pdf into using live occupancy to control hvac was developed for the department of energy by pacific northwest national laboratory pnnl which suggested the potential for upwards of 23 energy savings nomad go is the first edge computer vision platform to provide the necessary level of accuracy for live occupancy to effectively control hvac to save energy and reduce co2 the federal government has set goal of reducing the carbon footprint of buildings by 50 percent by the year 2035 primarily through the retrofitting of some four million buildings across the country to learn more about nomad go visual intelligence and our free assessment contact us at info nomad

programs shaping ai photograph jonathan raa nurphoto rex shutterstocktechscapetechnology black box and neural networks all the ai acronyms you need to knowwe spell out the key terms behind the ai revolution and why they matter plus this week top tech stories 06 40 esti took six weeks off to raise baby and everyone decided it was the time to declare the ai revolution imminent it hard not to take it personally the tick tock of new developments each more impressive than the last and each arriving on the scene faster than the last hit its apogee last week with the near simultaneous announcement of google bard and microsoft bing chat since then there been possible permutation of the discourse from millenarian claims of an imminent ai eschaton to rejection of the entire field as glorified autocomplete not here to settle that debate instead if 2023 is the year ai changes everything then early in that year is the time to dig little deeper into what it is how it works and why it is what it is and the best way to do that is to start talking about all those little terms that get left out of mainstream coverage because they re too techy what the key ai acronyms and jargon really meanneural networkneural networks are the fundamental technology at the heart of the ai boom think of them as the equivalent of the steam engine in the first industrial revolution general purpose technology that can reach out into myriad different industries and use cases and transform them first conceived in the 1940s neural networks began as efforts to model animal brains which are made of millions of simple neurons each connected to few others each individual neuron is extremely simple but quantity begets quality and enough of them together can learn to perform complex tasks and the same is true of artificial neural networks though those neurons are purely algorithmic ideas rather than physical connections like the steam engine it took decades for the true power of the invention to be understood neural network only works with enormous quantities of computing power and data so they have been curios for most of the last 70 years that changed at the turn of the millennium and the age of ai began sputtering slowing into existence llma large language model or llm is one of the two major ai approaches that have led to the latest burst of progress in the sector it describes neural networks that are trained using huge collections of text data like openai gpt series google palm or meta llama for instance palm uses high quality web documents books wikipedia conversations and github code to develop an understanding of language the question an llm is trying to answer is simple given short section of text what comes next but performing that task well is incredibly powerful for one thing it recursive once you ve predicted what comes next you have new slightly longer section of text which you can feed back into the llm and repeat the question generating whole sentences paragraphs articles or books the question is also general purpose predicting what comes next for short chunk of factual english text is different from predicting what comes next for short chunk of code or question or poem or pair of translated sentences or logic puzzle but the same approach seems to work quite well for all of those tasks the larger the language model the better the result gpt is 500 times bigger than gpt and we don seem to be close to discovering the limit renaissance style ai generated portraits made through stable diffusion composite universal public domain dedicationganwhat llms have done for text generative adversarial networks have done for images films music and more strictly speaking gan is two neural networks one built to label categorise and rate and the other built to create from scratch by pairing them together you can create an ai that can generate content on command say you want an ai that can make pictures first you do the hard work of creating the labelling ai one that can see an image and tell you what is in it by showing it millions of images that have already been labelled until it learns to recognise and describe dog bird or photograph of an orange cut in half showing that its inside is that of an apple then you take that program and use it to train second ai to trick it that second ai wins if it can create an image to which the first ai will give the desired label once you ve trained that second ai you ve got what you set out to build an ai that you can give label and get picture that it thinks matches the label or song or video or 3d model computetraining new ai model can be expensive the final creation of gpt took around 10m of computing time based on openai research papers and left unsaid is how many abortive efforts it took before the final run came out as intended that hurdle access to compute or computing power means that big general purpose tools like llms tend to be the purview of massive companies as far back as 2018 openai was warning that the amount of compute used in ai training runs was doubling every three and half months year later for that reason the company announced that it would be shifting from nonprofit model because of the need to invest billions of dollars in upcoming years into large scale cloud compute the uk is world leader in ai research thanks to the golden triangle of oxford cambridge and london but academics are often limited in their access to the amount of compute they need to work at the cutting edge which has led to the commercial gains being captured by the american and chinese corporate giants with billions to invest that has led to calls for government owned britgpt built with public funds to provide the compute that uk researchers lack the chatgpt bot seen on an iphone photograph koshiro alamyblack boxneural networks are often described as black box the more competent they get the harder it is to work out how they do what they do gpt contains 175bn parameters each of which describes how strongly or weakly one neuron affects another but it almost impossible to say what any given parameter does for the llm as whole skip past newsletter

promotioneven the overall structure of the neural networks is something of mystery sometimes we can get glimpse of order the in gpt stands for transformer way of wiring up the neural network to allow it to mimic short term memory which obviously makes sense for something that involves reading sentence word at time but other aspects of neural network design are more trial and error for instance it seems that forcing neural network to squeeze its thinking through bottleneck of just few neurons can improve the quality of the output why we don really know it just does fine tuningnot everything requires training an ai model from scratch you can think of the 10m spent on gpt as the cost of teaching an ai to read and write perfect english but if all you want to do is develop an ai that can say write good scientific articles you don need to start from scratch when ais that can read english already exist instead you can fine tune those ais on the specific data you want them to learn from teaching them hyper specific skills for fraction of the cost but there risk in doing so such fine tuning inevitably relies on the initial training which may not have been under your control alignmentat one level ai alignment is simple question have we actually trained the ai to do what we want it to do if we want an ai that can predict which prisoners are likely to reoffend but the ai is using racial profiling as core part of its decision we might describe it as unaligned with our desires sometimes ai can be unaligned because of bad training data which embeds within it biases and inaccuracies if an ai is trained to spot reoffenders based on dataset of prisoners for instance it will never know about those who aren sent to prison if it trained to speak english with dataset that includes all of twitter it might start spouting idiosyncratic beliefs about the links between bill gates 5g and covid vaccines other times ai can be unaligned because we ve asked it the wrong question an llm is designed to predict what text comes next but sometimes that isn really what we want sometimes we would rather have true answers than likely ones sometimes we would rather have answers that don repeat racial slurs or threaten the user or provide instructions to build bombs but that isn the question we asked the ai and sometimes alignment is used to mean something more existential say you ask an ai to optimise your factory floor to maximise hourly output and it decides the most important thing to do is ensure no one interrupts production for the next billion years so it hides in its plans technology that would kill every organic life form on the planet that would also be an unaligned ai the wider techscapethe result of crochet pattern for narwhal using chatgpt are you scared by

key to gpt 4thealgorithmicbridge substack comcopy linktwitterfacebookemailwhispering lips credit author via midjourney stable diffusiontoday covering subfield of ai never thought be writing about mostly because it much more mature than the ones usually write about large language models ai art and no breakthroughs were in sight but was mistaken referring to automatic speech recognition asr as you surely have inferred from the headline bear with me because there are good reasons to read this news openai announced whisper couple of days ago and people are already going crazy not because it new concept or because of improvements in algorithm design no the reason is simpler whisper works better than any other commercial asr system alexa siri google assistant these are the ones you re probably familiar with any of them will feel like last century tech after you try whisper and you can openai the company that tends to not do justice to its name decided to open source this model the digital experience is going to radically change for many people let see if the tech rises to the buzz brief overview of whisper what it is and doesopenai describes whisper as general purpose end to end weakly supervised transformer based asr family of models let see what all this jargon means in simpler words general purpose means that whisper in addition to the core task of speech recognition can do all the peripheral tasks like voice detection language identification transcription and machine translation end to end means the models were trained seamlessly without human intervention or hand made modules in contrast to training the parts for peripheral tasks separately and then merging them weakly means the threshold to accept audio data was lower than usual lower quality data can improve the model generalization capabilities supervised means it trained on audio text pairs in contrast to previous models that are self supervised the reason for the change is in the dataset more on this later transformer based you already know it predicts the next element in the sequence by attending to previous elements as side note openai researchers chose the original transformer architecture instead of fancier modern version because they didn want to make whisper great through model improvements they wanted to prove that high quality supervised asr is possible if enough data is available since the focus of our work is on studying the capabilities of large scale supervised pre training for speech recognition we use an off the shelf architecture to avoid confounding our findings with model improvements and it family because whisper has five versions from smallest to largest in terms of parameters tiny 39m base 74b small 244b medium 769m and large 55b you may find it surprising that they re small compared to large language models llms like gpt 175b or lamda 137b making good enough generative language model is next level quest compared to other ai applications from here on when mention whisper it ll be whisper large model size matters for quality unless stated otherwise read more here blog demos available paper github repo model card colab example and code okay that was the most technical bit of the article you don have to remember any details to understand the next sections what want to focus on now is what makes whisper relevant to you and the ai community in general ve read all the resources linked above and ve compiled list of what consider to be whisper eight key features both at research and production levels sharewhisper in keys what makes it special1 whisper has super high accuracyeven if it not always state of the art sota in asr benchmarks whisper matches human performance in real world settings better than alternatives from the paper these results indicate that whisper english asr performance is not perfect but very close to human level accuracy this means that you ll find whisper better at understanding you than any other asr system as said alexa or siri are significantly worse if the conditions aren optimal this extrapolates to real world scenarios with background noise fast speech or heavy accent more on this later people not affiliated with openai who have tried the system report being impressed by the quality for instance andrej karpathy ex director of ai at tesla tweeted this earlier today andrej karpathy karpathyplaying with whisper fed in 1m25s audio snippet from one of my lectures speak fast correct myself and backtrack bit use technical terms mlp rnn gru 10 seconds later the 292 word transcription is perfect except benjio et al 2003 should be bengio impressed september 23rd 2022290 retweets3 791 likes2 whisper is open sourceopenai open sourced whisper under an mit license there clear trend among ai companies to make the models and code available opt bloom stable diffusion this practice improves the democratization of ai tools and equally important permits better assessment of how they work where they fail and how they can be improved ve previously argued that open source is the way forward for ai and when done with safety in mind it creates much stronger impact than ai under strict control and privacy companies like google which is falling behind in these types of practices opening secondary tech vs opening the best you have are very different things will have hard time leveraging the possibilities if they remain closed dall mini success over dall is lesson for every ai company that thinks great quality openness whisper is easy to usethis goes hand in hand with it being open source hugging face has already set up demo you can use on your computer or smartphone data scientist yuvi sharma built speech text speech system using whisper speech to text bloom text generation and coquitts text to speech you talk whisper recognizes and transcribes your speech bloom generates text according to what you asked and coqui makes an audio file from it all in less than mins this reminds me of what has been happening with stable diffusion this month developers are releasing tools and resources non stop and luckily for us most are no code this is the result of open source policies more accessibility for all for the coders out there you can always download whisper into your computer and play with the code the largest model requires 10gb vram so not for everybody the smallest requires 1gb vram and is 32x faster but notably worse quality there are three versions in between whisper is multilingualthere also trend to make ai more inclusive the english speaking world is large but 94 of the population doesn speak it as their first language and 75 don speak it at all thousands of millions of people native languages had been forgotten until now bloom is an llm that works for up to 46 languages and pioneered multilingualism as core feature of ai models meta ai released the project no language left behind nllb in june it aims to open source ai models that can perform machine translation between 200 languages openai trained whisper in 97 languages the other 96 languages account for 17 of the dataset it still insufficient people who speak languages that aren well represented in the data will experience reduced quality and there several order of magnitude gap between languages that are widely represented on the internet like chinese 23 5k hours on whisper dataset or spanish 11 1k and others that aren like hindi 12 or bengali despite being spoken by millions of people less common languages although reasonably less present in the data are still the first language for many people across the world the people who would benefit the most from these types of technological advances whisper can enhance many applications across industriesregarding real world uses imagine that you had turbocharged siri or alexa not in terms of intelligence but in terms of being perfect at transcribing your speeches you could take study notes with your voice without having to check them constantly you could enjoy instant accurate subtitles in youtube videos or movies and companies will certainly embed whisper into existing services alexa won fail to catch what you say anymore regardless of noise accent or speech cadence if amazon is smart even more importantly whisper could signify life quality improvement for people with speech or hearing impairment for instance you could instantly transcribe your words for deaf person it could be an improvement in inclusivity for consumer services and all this without mentioning the uses for professional work law healthcare banking marketing education virtually every industry could benefit from this and the use cases are nothing short of innumerable whisper is multitaskingas explained in the beginning whisper does asr but also all the tasks that surround the core problem for instance whisper was also trained on english translation 18 of the dataset and was evaluated on language identification performance similar to sota models in general this makes whisper easier to integrate with existing products or services and easier to deploy whisper is robust and generalizes wellthis is related to the high accuracy point but think it worth emphasizing one of the main limitations of existing asr systems is that the underlying models are trained on specific datasets or combination of them that have laboratory type of quality this means the models do well when evaluated on target benchmarks but even slight deviations from that cause huge drops in quality whisper was trained on lot of data in weakly supervised manner and that makes it more robust and capable of generalizing to out of distribution scenarios out of distribution means in simple words that train and test data have different essential features for instance whisper is better at understanding accents or fast speech recognizing technical jargon and punctuation signs and it better at detecting silence or removing background noise than alternatives whisper training dataset is large diverse and privateit all looked too perfect so far if you were expecting but moment here it is whisper has dark side for those of you who work on tech this feature will instantly stand out let start with the objective part whisper was trained on 680k hours of audio text data that 77 years scraped from the web this is an order of magnitude more than the largest existing supervised dataset on this type of data somehow this makes whisper breakthrough in audio text data acquisition more than breakthrough in algorithm design or scaling laws openai researchers got to prove that data scaling is very influential in the quality of the asr system this makes the dataset key aspect of whisper release if it wasn for all the data openai has gathered whisper wouldn exist now the shady part the dataset is private openai decided to nod to their name by opening the inference models and the code but decided to keep the dataset closed why don know and no one knows where the data came from they explain in the paper that machine generated data often lack sufficient quality so they came up with some heuristics to remove it but did they remove it all if it not from an ai source where did they find 10x human labeled data lot of open questions that openai doesn seem to be willing to address this means that developers and laypeople can still benefit from whisper but university researchers can analyze the data provenance or the potential biases within here good thread on this and other tech companies can build on openai findings to maybe building and open source an improved version more intriguing is the question of why would they keep it closed they obviously don plan to profit from whisper directly ll let you think about this because think there more to what meets the eye don have answers only speculation so let speculate this is where the fun begins the algorithmic bridge is reader supported publication to receive new posts and support my work consider becoming free or paid subscriber subscribebeyond whisper crazy hypothesis about openai futurewhy would openai want to keep whisper training set private haven been able to find any reliable source that knows the answer there are many possible boring hypotheses for instance openai doesn want the dataset to be available to competitors because they plan to leverage it for profit in some way another option is that there are legal issues in place web scraping can be tricky and they prefer to remain silent another option is simply that it their modus operandi and they didn see reason to change it now despite their apparent shift toward openness but there more exciting possibility and quite plausible if you ask me this hypothesis was shared on twitter by ethan caballero an ml ph student at the mila quebec ai institute ethan caballero is busy ethancaballerowhisper is how openai is getting the many trillions of english text tokens that are needed to train compute optimal chinchilla scaling law gpt openai openaiwe ve trained neural net called whisper that approaches human level robustness and accuracy on english speech recognition it performs well even on diverse accents and technical language whisper is open source for all to use https co uevywypekkseptember 21st 202256 retweets602 likesokay let me explain first gpt it the next version for the gpt family gpt was published in 2018 gpt in 2019 and gpt in 2020 it was expected that gpt would be released in 2021 but openai focused on ai art clip and dall now after two years of waiting the release date feels very close earlier this year in april wrote an article on gpt entitled gpt is coming soon here what we know about it if you go to google search and type gpt it still the number one result which makes me proud anyway predicted back then that gpt would be released in july or august the sudden interest in ai art probably slowed it down can know for sure but be willing to bet that we ll have gpt in the next couple of months reasons below in that same article reviewed the most significant advancements the ai community had embraced since 2020 in the field of llms and matched them with the little information we had on gpt sam altman openai ceo conducted private in late 2021 one of the points highlighted was that gpt wouldn be larger than gpt but it be much more optimized in terms of computing resources and notable leap in performance capabilities for that openai would need much more data here where deepmind chinchilla comes into play deepmind found that the generally accepted scaling laws how to make models more performant by enlarging some feature compute data or size were incomplete making the models bigger was only half the story to make them more performant the other half data deepmind researchers found that they could build an llm compute optimal if they used more training data while keeping the number of parameters fixed they proved their hypothesis right with chinchilla 70b parameter model that reached instant sota status surpassing by significant margin lamda 137b gpt 175b j1 jumbo 178b gopher 280b and mt nlg 530b they found all those models were undertrained chinchilla had gotten the most out of the training data given its size here when we circle back to caballero hypothesis to train gpt size model as compute optimal openai needs much more data than what deepmind needed to train the 70b parameter chinchilla caballero guess openai will use whisper to transcribe speech data from the internet and generate all the text data they re lacking to train gpt as compute optimal to build compute optimal gpt openai would need 10x more data than they used for gpt from 300b to 7t tokens credit chinchilla paperi predicted back in april that openai would dismiss the older scaling laws and implement deepmind findings onto gpt if caballero hypothesis is true my prediction will turn out correct but is it possible commenter on caballero thread estimated that just youtube audio data amounts to around 12 trillion tokens that more than enough to train compute optimal gpt size gpt 7t tokens and even models the size of mt nlg or palm 11t tokens of course they ll also need more computing power but given that microsoft backs openai they won have any problem with that what can we expect if openai pulls this off as popular tech blogger robert scoble said in tweet last month we can expect gpt to be just as exciting leap as gpt was insane if that ends up being true can even begin to imagine the possibilities also he implicitly said that gpt is almost ready whisper may just be the last link of the chain my release date predictions were off but possibly not by long shot robert scoble scobleizera friend has access to gpt and can talk about it due to ndas was about to tell me everything about it and then remembered who he was talking to his emotion alone told me it is next level kareem carr kareem carrfinally tried out the gpt model from openai the

Italian Garante bans Chat GPT from processing personal data of Italian data subjects | Data Protection Report,the italian data protection authority garante per la protezione dei dati personali the garante ordered the us company open ai llc to temporarily stop chatgpt processing of personal data relating to individuals located in italy pending the outcome of the garante investigation into the privacy practices of chatgpt the alleged gdpr infringements the garante apparently took its action after becoming aware of recent data breach at chatgpt where users chat titles and payment information was exposed this led to the garante seeking further information from open ai and noting the following alleged gdpr violations failure to provide the required transparency information about chatgpt processing of their personal data to users and other data subjects whose data is collected by chatgpt failure to verify users age meaning that users under 13 years of age may allegedly obtain answers from chatgpt not appropriate to their degree of development and self awareness and in contravention of the chatgpt terms this is the first action of its kind taken by data protection authority in the eu in relation to the data processing by the popular generative ai tool and it deals in particular the hot topic of data processing in the context of training of machine learning software the order by the garante does not elaborate specifically on organisations ability to rely on legitimate interests for the collection and use of personal data by the ai engine for training purposes the interim measure also does not draw distinction between using personal data to build or train an algorithmic model versus actually inputting personal data into developed given algorithmic model nor the impact of this distinction on the balancing test that must be undertaken when relying on legitimate interests the garante view on these matters will hopefully become clear following its investigation this is however not the first order by the italian dpa in relation to ai more generally as in february 2023 the regulator issued measure preventing the app replika chat bot acting as virtual friend to users from processing personal data of individuals resident in italy the garante action is the most headline grabbing action by data protection authority in the ai space to date because of its impact on chatgpt which is reportedly the fastest growing consumer application in history however it is reflective of the recent increased focus by european data protection authorities on ai with the dutch french spanish and uk regulators all increasing their oversight of ai and publishing materials in this area about more than news source the data protection report provides thought leadership on emerging privacy data protection and cybersecurity issues and helps its readers proactively address risks and anticipate next steps in this crucial emerging field

Alphabet shares dive after Google AI chatbot Bard flubs answer in ad,alphabet inc lost 100 billion in market value on wednesday after its new chatbot shared inaccurate information in promotional video and company event failed to dazzle feeding worries that the google parent is losing ground to rival microsoft corp alphabet shares slid as much as during regular trading with volumes nearly three times the 50 day moving average they pared losses after hours and were roughly flat the stock had lost 40 of its value last year but rallied 15 since the beginning of this year excluding wednesday losses reuters was first to point out an error in google advertisement for chatbot bard which debuted on monday about which satellite first took pictures of planet outside the earth solar system google has been on its heels after openai startup microsoft is backing with around 10 billion introduced software in november that has wowed consumers and become fixation in silicon valley circles for its surprisingly accurate and well written answers to simple prompts google live streamed presentation on wednesday morning did not include details about how and when it would integrate bard into its core search function day earlier microsoft held an event touting that it had already released to the public version of its bing search with chatgpt functions integrated while google has been leader in ai innovation over the last several years they seemed to have fallen asleep on implementing this technology into their search product said gil luria senior software analyst at davidson google has been scrambling over the last few weeks to catch up on search and that caused the announcement yesterday tuesday to be rushed and the embarrassing mess up of posting wrong answer during their demo alphabet posted short gif video of bard in action via twitter promising it would help simplify complex topics but it instead delivered an inaccurate answer in the advertisement bard is given the prompt what new discoveries from the james webb space telescope jwst can tell my year old about bard responds with number of answers including one suggesting the jwst was used to take the very first pictures of planet outside the earth solar system or exoplanets the first pictures of exoplanets were however taken by the european southern observatory very large telescope vlt in 2004 as confirmed by nasa this highlights the importance of rigorous testing process something that we re kicking off this week with our trusted tester program google spokesperson said we ll combine external feedback with our own internal testing to make sure bard responses meet high bar for quality safety and groundedness in real world information people are starting to question is microsoft going to be formidable competitor now against google really bread and butter business said king lip chief strategist at baker avenue wealth management which owns alphabet and microsoft shares lip cautioned though that concerns about alphabet may be overblown saying think still bing is far far cry away from google search capabilities the new chatgpt software has injected excitement into technology firms after tens of thousands of job cuts in recent weeks and executive pledges to pare back on so called moonshot projects ai has become fixation for tech executives who have mentioned it as much as six times more often on recent earnings calls than in prior quarters reuters found the appeal of ai driven search is that it could spit out results in plain language rather than in list of links which could make browsing faster and more efficient it remains unclear what impact that might have on targeted advertising the backbone of search engines like google chatbot ai systems also carry risks for corporations because of inherent biases in their algorithms that can skew results sexualize images or even plagiarize as consumers testing the service have discovered microsoft for instance released chatbot on twitter in 2016 that quickly began generating racist content before being shut down and an ai used by news site cnet was found to produce factually incorrect or plagiarized stories

legislature would create million pilot program to use cameras likely with artificial intelligence technology in high risk locations to help identify fires before they burn out of controldenver ap year after the most destructive wildfire in the state history scorched nearly 100 homes colorado lawmakers are considering joining other western states by adopting artificial intelligence in the hopes of detecting blazes before they burn out of control proposal that legislators will discuss in hearing thursday would create million pilot program to station cameras on mountaintops in high risk locations an artificial intelligence program developed by private company would analyze the images from cameras with 10 mile about 16 kilometer radiuses with the aim of detecting something that could signal the start of blaze it is part of an ongoing effort by firefighters to use new technology to become smarter about how they prepare and better position their resources fire lookout towers once staffed by humans have largely been replaced by cameras in remote areas many of them in high definition and armed with artificial intelligence to discern smoke plume from morning fog there are hundreds of such cameras scattered across california nevada and oregon and even casual viewers can remotely watch wildfires in real time historic drought and recent heat waves tied to climate change have made wildfires harder to fight in the american west and scientists say warming weather will continue to make fires more frequent and destructive record breaking storms that drenched california with more than 11 inches of rain in recent weeks and big snow dumps in other states have improved conditions in the short term but the drought persists across most of nevada california and utah and large areas of other western states according to tuesday report from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration the goal of the colorado program would be for cameras and an ai algorithm to detect plume of smoke and alert first responders who can stomp out the conflagration before it grows said don coram former republican colorado state senator who first backed the idea and encouraged this year sponsor rep cleave simpson republican and rancher once these fires get into cresting in the tree tops it going to take lot of resources lot of manpower and lot of good luck to knock them down coram said thursday hearing will include testimony from ai wildfire detection company called pano ai the company began working with cities including the ski resort town of aspen colorado and has expanded to cities and counties in six states their stations include two cameras mounted on high vantage point rotating at 360 degrees and connected to the company ai software each station costs roughly 50 000 every year arvind satyam the chief commercial officer at pano ai said that the artificial intelligence uses data set of over 300 million images that teaches it what is smoke billowing up from fire and what isn once camera signals that there could be fire the photos and information are run through the company intelligence center for human vetting the algorithm could ve mistaken tractor dust cloud or even geyser for pillar of smoke before it sent along to fire agencies he said satyam added that the benefits go beyond detection allowing fire agencies to pinpoint blaze location and monitor live feed of the burn ai has gained notoriety for breaking into number of fields from creating propaganda and disinformation to writing essays or cover letters about whatever the user requests david blankinship senior technology advisor for the western fire chiefs association said fire agencies have come to rely on this type of detection technology especially in california where the programs have been put to

projected to reach the valuation of us 3013 million by the year 2026 by growing at cagr of 21 this can be attributed to factors such as rising demand for agricultural production increased adoption of advanced technologies and smart sensors rapid demand for drones in farms and increased need for monitoring of livestock using ai in agriculture provides various focal points such as maximizing product yields using machine learning and image recognition methods for example the international crops research institute for semi arid tropics icrisat partnered with microsoft to develop an ai based sowing app that sends sowing alerts to ranchers indicating the following date earlier technological innovations and the modernization of gps make ranchers and agricultural specialist cooperatives expect that further changes would increase profitability for example in addition to the present non military benefits offered by gps nations are preparing to upgrade second and third signal on gps satellites this execution of new flags will improve the quality and in addition the ability of farming activities and in the coming years will increase the overall productivity driverless tractor is technological development as these tractors can automatically steer using gps based technology raise tools from the ground identify farm boundaries and can be remotely operated using smartphone smaller fleet of automated tractors could increase farmers incomes by more than 10 per cent and increased farm labor costs the market is driven by rise in the adoption of cattle face recognition technology through applying advanced metrics including facial recognition systems for cattle and image classification combined with body condition score and feeding habits dairy farms are now able to monitor all behavioral factors in cattle group individually increasing use of unmanned aerial vehicles uavs across agricultural farms is driving the market as the use of drones in the agricultural industry can be used in crop field scanning with compact multi spectral imaging sensors gps map production through on board cameras heavy payload transport and monitoring of livestock with thermal camera equipped drones which increases the demand for uavs drones fitted with hyperspectral multispectral or thermal sensors can locate areas that require irrigation changes when crops have begun to develop these sensors can measure their vegetation index and health indicator via ai by measuring the heat signature of the crop as the global population is projected to exceed xx billion by 2050 it is expected that agricultural consumption will increase by massive ratio where drones have now been mainstreamed for smart farming to assist farmers in range of tasks from analysis and planning to actual crop planting and subsequent field monitoring to determine health and growth ageagle aerial systems company that acquired agrobotix llc plans to develop new products with new technologies such as weather data advanced image recognition and precise analysis to give farmers consumers better recommendations followed by north america high growth rates in asia pacific are expected in the coming years due

EXPLAINER: What is ChatGPT and why are schools blocking it? | Taiwan News | 2023-01-07 03:32:29,new york city school officials started blocking this week the impressive but controversial writing tool that can generate paragraphs of human like text ap photo peter morgan ask the new artificial intelligence tool chatgpt to write an essay about the cause of the american civil war and you can watch it churn out persuasive term paper in matter of seconds that one reason why new york city school officials this week started blocking the impressive but controversial writing tool that can generate paragraphs of human like text the decision by the largest school district to restrict the chatgpt website on school devices and networks could have ripple effects on other schools and teachers scrambling to figure out how to prevent cheating the creators of chatgpt say they re also looking for ways to detect misuse the free tool has been around for just five weeks but is already raising tough questions about the future of ai in education the tech industry and host of professions chatgpt launched on nov 30 but is part of broader set of technologies developed by the san francisco based startup openai which has close relationship with microsoft it part of new generation of ai systems that can converse generate readable text on demand and even produce novel images and video based on what they ve learned from vast database of digital books online writings and other media but unlike previous iterations of so called large language models such as openai gpt launched in 2020 the chatgpt tool is available for free to anyone with an internet connection and designed to be more user friendly it works like written dialogue between the ai system and the person asking it questions millions of people have played with it over the past month using it to write silly poems or songs to try to trick it into making mistakes or for more practical purposes such as helping compose an email all of those queries are also helping it get smarter its launch came with little guidance for how to use it other than promise that chatgpt will admit when it wrong challenge incorrect premises and reject requests meant to generate offensive answers since then however its popularity has led its creators to try to lower some people expectations chatgpt is incredibly limited but good enough at some things to create misleading impression of greatness openai ceo sam altman said on twitter in december this is what chatgpt said when the associated press asked it to answer that question in all caps from the perspective of principal shouting brief message through school pa system but when asked to answer the same question on its own chatgpt offered this more measured warning as general rule it is not appropriate to use chatgpt or any other automated writing tool for school papers as it is considered cheating and does not benefit the student in the long run the new york city education department said thursday that it restricting access on school networks and devices because it worried about negative impacts on student learning as well as concerns regarding the safety and accuracy of content while the tool may be able to provide quick and easy answers to questions it does not build critical thinking and problem solving skills which are essential for academic and lifelong success said schools spokesperson jenna lyle openai said in human written statement this week that it plans to work with educators as it learns from how people are experimenting with chatgpt in the real world we don want chatgpt to be used for misleading purposes in schools or anywhere else so we re already developing mitigations to help anyone identify text generated by that system the company said there been some speculation that chatgpt could upend the internet search business now dominated by google but the tech giant has been working on similar technology for years it just more cautious about releasing it in the wild it was google that helped jumpstart the trend for ever bigger ever smarter ai language models that could be pre trained on wide body of writings in 2018 the company introduced system known as bert that uses transformer technique that compares words across sentence to predict meaning and context some of those advances are now baked into google searches but there no question that successive iterations of gpt which stands for generative pre trained transformer are having an impact microsoft has invested at least billion in openai and has an exclusive license to use gpt

firms are keen on using ai to automate the repair of complex machinery thereby increasing efficacy and solving technical issues this development was showcased in germany industrial home fair where workers used ai equipped virtual assistants to operate robots hpe has partnered with german start up aleph alpha to offer an ai programme that communicates with factory teams to detect machine issues or check correct installation potentially reducing the gap caused by the 58 shortfall of skilled labour in germany manufacturing sector afpmanufacturers are hoping for the artificial intelligence revolution to reach their factories envisaging robots being used to repair complex machinery there has been an explosion of interest in uses of ai across many sectors since the launch last year of chatbot chatgpt from us startup openai and at last week hanover fair on industrial technology in germany the potential for artificial intelligence in the manufacturing sector was firmly in focus via the tablet in his hands young employee of american it services provider hpe chatted with an ai equipped virtual assistant asking it to operate the arm of robot in order to solve technical problem factory workers no longer need to get qualified expert on site the artificial intelligence takes charge of guiding the repairs said thomas meier data analyst from hpe who was presenting the prototype the us firm which has some 60 000 employees has been working for the past year with aleph alpha german startup with some 50 staff seen as one of openai leading european rivals the innovation communicates with factory workers who can for example send photo of machine for the programme to detect any problems or check that it is correctly installed aleph alpha resources are modest compared to those available to openai which has received major financing from microsoft but the german startup believes it has at least one major advantage it will keep customer data in europe increasing

application aimed at improving factory performance in partnership with microsoft the german industrial conglomerate is this year planning to bring out new version of the teams messaging platform it will feature chatgpt and be specifically designed to help workers and spot defaults in products microsoft and siemens who say they are working with number of clients in the automotive and aerospace industries rejected accusation that ai will lead to job losses anthony hemmelgarn ceo of siemens digital industries software said that 70 percent of issues were not being recorded and that ai was not replacing anybody as certain tasks were not getting done it all about increasing efficiency he added another advantage that ai could bring is alleviating the shortage of skilled workers particularly in germany said jochen koeckler head of the hanover fair organisers in europe biggest economy almost 58 percent of manufacturers complain of workforce shortages according to study by the federal institute for vocational education and training published in december for andrulis ai will undoubtedly lead to huge upheavals in the world of work but he also sought to offer assurances it not like ai

How this secretive AI startup is helping call center employees - Business Insider,companies are getting inundated with customer service calls as the coronavirus pandemic upends life for most americans for help some turn to asapp the secretive ai startup augments the work done by call center employees through its platform that among other things provides automated responses and provides full customer call history ceo gustavo sapoznik thinks it could beat industry leaders like microsoft and become the next great enterprise software company built around ai lot of those tech giants are not interested in playing in that space even if they have those capabilities he told business insider in an exclusive interview follow all of business insider latest updates on the coronavirus here click here for more bi prime stories for help some are turning to asapp the secretive startup is empowering agents with tools including automated responses and complete customer interaction history with the goal of revolutionary seamless interactions for employees and customers the company says it has raised over 200 million in funding its last update in pitchbook put total funding at 57 million but apart from publishing academic papers on its technology asapp has done few outside interviews in an exclusive interview with business insider at its headquarters in one world trade center ceo gustavo sapoznik laid out his plans to create the next great enterprise software company built around artificial intelligence while it crowded space he argued there immense opportunity that current industry behemoths like microsoft and others are ill positioned to take advantage of creating opportunity for an incumbent player like asapp someone will build the next big tech company on the backs of machine learning we would argue it likely going to be new company not one of the incumbents he said lot of those tech giants are not interested in playing in that space even if they have those capabilities the company initial product for example is targeted at call centers but it plans to expand into new sector every three to five years and sapoznik has the healthcare sector in his sights he said the goal for the next platform is one that lets insurance companies and hospitals have better digital interactions with customers tackling the call center challengecustomer service is one of the largest divisions within corporations often employing tens of thousands of individuals and yet for many consumers it is still maddening experience resolving issues can take hours factoring in hold times other delays and archaic systems and there are too many gaps information discussed with an agent over the phone for example is easily transferred if customer were to want to transition to chatting via the company mobile app instead recent solutions like online chatbots have been largely ineffective in solving many of these problems large enterprises need to become digitally competent in how they deal and interact with their customers said sapoznik lot of organizations operate because of the historical technological decisions they made with digital incompetence that where asapp platform comes in the system uses speech recognition software to analyze customer inquiries on any medium phone mobile app or website and provide automated replies that agents can use and the interaction history is all stored for quick reference regardless of how an individual is reaching the customer service center say someone wanted to contact verizon to complain about slow internet an agent would be able to see if he or she had similar problem several months ago and if the individual were to ask about an upgrade to faster speeds the system would automatically present the agent with an option to send the available offerings everything the research does is not product specific it task specific said sapoznik asapp then cross pollinates the efforts of our research organization across different product lines while fears are rampant that automation will destroy jobs the reality for many is that the technology remains too nascent to fully replace humans it why companies like asapp have been so successful because they aim to augment employees instead of ousting them whether that goal changes however is largely dependent on just how quickly technology advances sap helped client secure 500 hospital beds in just 30 minutes and it shows the power of digital transformations in helping companies respond to the coronavirus pandemic

New Research Says Yes - South Florida Reporter,chatgpt the hugely popular artificial intelligence chatbot can do lot it can write song give you advice or help plan road trip but can it predict stock price movements according to new research paper yes alejandro lopez lira and yuehua tang two finance professors at the university of florida put the chatbot to the test and found that chatgpt can often use news headlines to determine whether stock price will go up or down in just few months chatgpt has taken the world by storm tech giants like microsoft and google have entered the chatbot search wars and investors are quickly seeking ways to put their money towards the future of ai money spoke with the florida researchers about what exactly their findings mean and how ai could change the world of finance here how the experiment worked lopez lira and tang asked chatgpt to determine if about 40 000 headlines published between october 2021 and december 2022 about stocks listed on the new york stock exchange nasdaq and american stock exchange were positive or negative for the stock the researchers predict that if investing firms were not already using this technology they ll start now and that the markets will become more efficient because of it meaning stock prices will better reflect all the most up to date information more efficient market is harder for investors to beat if before the headline took one day to fully absorb in the market perhaps now it will take like one minute lopez lira tells money as investors start incorporating these language models into their framework they can trade much faster and the prices should adapt quickly keep in mind that it typically institutional investors who have the infrastructure to actually do this and of course if everyone started using chatgpt in this way to help make investing decisions doing so would no longer give you an edge he adds though there may be more room for large language models like chatgpt to predict movements of small stocks and international stocks since many institutional investors are paying closer attention to larger stocks and therefore making those markets more efficient the researchers say chatgpt entering the conversation could also have an impact on regulation as investors rely more and more on news and headlines some regulators might need to step in to guarantee that the information is accurate and not misleading lopez lira says

UltraSight Receives CE Mark for Novel Cardiac AI Technology,at 30 am edt updated 36 minutes agolandmark achievement paves the way for increased patient access to cardiac imaging and optimized care across europe in 2023barcelona spain prnewswire ultrasight an israeli based digital health pioneer transforming cardiac imaging through the power of artificial intelligence announced it has obtained ce mark for its ai guidance software for cardiac ultrasound today milestone comes just ahead of the european society of cardiology esc congress in barcelona and aligns with its call for action to achieve heart health in europe by 2025 ultrasight prnewswire ultrasight technology allows medical professionals regardless of their sonography experience to successfully capture diagnostic quality ultrasound images of the heart the technology can be used at the point of care paving the way for more widespread detection of cardiovascular diseases cvd and improved access to optimized cardiac care across the continent the novel ai software pairs with point of care ultrasound devices that are currently on the market and provides the operator with real time instructions on how to capture high quality diagnostic images the underlying ai neural network predicts the position of the ultrasound probe relative to the heart based on the ultrasound video stream only and guides the user on how to maneuver the probe to ensure that the acquired images are of diagnostic quality ultrasight was founded with the intention to apply the power of machine learning in imaging and put the ability to scan patients into the hands of physicians everywhere said davidi vortman ceo of ultrasight by empowering more medical professionals to accurately scan patients we will have faster and greater detection of cvd across the continent this is not only momentous occasion for ultrasight as company but it brings us one step closer to helping the millions of people in europe who suffer from cvd according to the esc1 there are 113 million people living with cvd in europe today europe has the highest cvd mortality rate in the world with approximately four million people succumbing to this disease each year cvd is the leading cause of death for europeans ultrasight obtained ce mark after results from clinical study held at the sheba medical center israel validated its technology and confirmed that the software is effective at instructing novice medical professionals to acquire diagnostic quality cardiac images the study found that ultrasight ai guidance allowed medical professionals who did not have prior sonography experience to obtain diagnostic quality cardiac images in 100 percent of patients the study was conducted using the philips lumify ultrasound device many medical residents have entered the healthcare field since the pandemic however being able to provide them with the necessary hands on training and supervision has become challenging for many european emergency departments looking to adopt point of care ultrasound said prof salvatore di somma md phd director of emergency medicine and chairman of the postgraduate school of emergency medicine at the department of medical surgery sciences and translational medicine university of sapienza in rome italy supporting new ultrasound users with ai guidance such as ultrasight ai guidance software would increase efficiencies and expedite the learning curve while also reducing the time for obtaining good echocardiographic imaging in the emergency room opening resources for experienced staff to respond to other acute needs point of care ultrasound can be very useful tool for intensive care unit physicians some key hemodynamic measurements such as left ventricular outflow tract velocity time integral lvot vti provide invaluable help to guide fluid therapy however some physicians are still reluctant to use it because they consider this measurement competence reserved for advanced ultrasound operators said professor bernard cholley icu department head at the pital europ en georges pompidou paris france when introduced to ultrasight ai guidance software we were very compelled by the prospect of ai supporting more healthcare providers including novice ultrasound users to acquire cardiac ultrasound view by which the lvot vti can be measured accurately for reliable measurement and optimized patient care the ultrasight ai guidance software is indicated for use in two dimensional transthoracic echocardiography 2d tte for adult patients it is intended to assist medical professionals in performing cardiac ultrasound scans ultrasight ai guidance software is an accessory to compatible general purpose diagnostic ultrasound systems and is intended to be used by medical professionals who have received ultrasight training as described in the user manual the ultrasight software is expected to become available in europe in 2023 for more information about ultrasight visit www ultrasight com adam timmis

No Job Is Future-Proof. How To Adopt AI While Protecting Your Employees,let get this straight artificial intelligence is automating away roles across industries it doesn matter how much creativity or critical thinking task might need no job is future proof elite college degrees impressive linkedin profiles or six figure salaries are no longer shields against obsolescence says kevin roose nyt tech columnist and author of the recent book futureproof rules for humans in the age of automation what the real human cost of ushering in this fantastic ai driven future can leaders realistically take care of their employees while tapping into the efficiencies of automation these are some of the questions asked roose in wide ranging interview ll unpack our conversation in this article providing answers to those queries and more ll also explain the four essential ways that organizations can embrace ai without compromising their commitment to employees however the problem is that this progress does arrive all at once there is immense short term pain that employees go through in the face of automation for example it was about 50 years after the start of industrialization that workers wages actually rose in proportion to corporate profits they had been producing more value for their employers that whole time but the benefits of automation were not passed back to them for nearly half century roose shares how hubert joly then ceo of best buy turned the company around focusing on humans to compete with amazon best buy invested in something that ai doesn do well customer service it launched an in home adviser program to complement geek squad its much loved team of tech support experts while best buy offered competitive pricing and used ml algorithms to improve its operational efficiencies the cornerstone of its turnaround strategy was humans this is an excellent reminder that organizations can not only embrace ai but can also leverage their team deeply human skills to re energize their business organizations competing in the age of ai face lot of pressures they wrestle with competitors over piece of the shifting market pie they innovate to serve fickle customer expectations and they juggle investor demands for growing returns on capital executives in turn are looking for ways that data and ai can help manage these forces it begs the question how can companies innovate with ai while also taking care of critical internal stakeholders their employees evaluate how ai can augment your business and improve your operating model you must explore ways that technology can help your people perform their jobs better in less than ten years every takeda employee will be empowered by an ai assistant says christophe weber the president and ceo of takeda he believes augmented intelligence will help his team make better decisions and deliver transformative experience to patients physicians and payers remember it may not always be possible to retain humans in workflow when it automated however ai often opens opportunities for innovative business offerings and new roles that can improve your competitive advantage as in best buy adviser program more than 60 of jobs performed in 2018 had not yet been invented in 1940 according to an mit report so invest in up skilling and out skilling your workforce proactively to prepare them for adjacent or new roles on similar note it not only possible but critical to take care of your employees as you adopt ai for example american wholesale retailer boxed used robots to automate 75 of jobs at its warehouse in union new jersey however not one employee was fired instead the team is being retrained to manage the bots maintain the software or handle customer service if you re in the boardroom talking about automation you also need to talk about the human impact and put your employees on top of the list says chieh huang ceo of boxed to prepare your organization for the future you must go back in time to study the previous waves of automation recommends roose technology driven change is not new and we aren starting from scratch today as organizations embrace technology innovation to meet rising business demands leaders must make responsible decisions by factoring in the interest of all stakeholders including their employees leaders must speak openly with employees about what ai means for their jobs and how technology can augment their roles when automation makes roles redundant leaders must communicate transparently plan ahead for redeployment and share how the organization can help employees with the transition the key to making the switch into an ai driven business is by earning your employees trust

"Like The Social Dilemma Did, The AI Dilemma Seeks To Mislead You With Misinformation | Techdirt",you may recall the social dilemma which used incredible levels of misinformation and manipulation in an attempt to warn about others using misinformation to manipulate on april 13 new youtube video called the ai dilemma was shared by social dilemma leading character tristan harris he encouraged his followers to share it widely in order to understand the likelihood of catastrophe unfortunately like the social dilemma the ai dilemma is big on hype and deception and not so big on accuracy or facts although it deals with different tech not social media algorithms but generative ai the creators still use the same manipulation and scare tactics there is an obvious resemblance between the moral panic techlash around social media and the one that being generated around ai as the ai dilemma shares and views are increasing we need to address its deceptive content first it clearly pulls from the same moral panic hype playbook as the social dilemma did the social dilemma argued that social media have godlike power over people controlling users like marionettes the ai dilemma argues that ai has godlike power over people the social dilemma argued that algorithms hijack our brains leaving us to do what they want without resistance the algorithms were played by dudes in control room and in some scenes the algorithms were mad in the ai dilemma this anthropomorphizing is taken to the next level we can summarize that the ai dilemma is full of weird depictions of ai according to experts the risk of anthropomorphizing ai is that it inflates the machine capabilities and distorts the reality of what it can and can do resulting in misguided fears in the case of this lecture that was the entire point the ai dilemma creators thought they had comic relief at 36 45 when they showed snippet from the little shop of horrors feed me but it was actually at 51 45 when tristan harris stated don want to be talking about the darkest horror shows of the world specific survey was mentioned times throughout the ai dilemma it was about how half of over 700 top academics and researchers stated that there was 10 percent or greater chance of human extinction from future ai systems or human inability to control future ai systems the extinction from ai question was what probability do you put on future ai advances causing human extinction or similarly permanent and severe disempowerment of the human species the extinction from human failure to control ai question was what probability do you put on human inability to control future advanced ai systems causing human extinction or similarly permanent and severe disempowerment of the human species there are plenty of vague phrases here from the disempowerment of the human species to the apparent absence of timeframe for this unclear futuristic scenario ai impacts contacted attendees of two ml conferences neurlps icml not gathering of the broader ai community in which only 17 responded to their survey in general and much smaller percentage were asked to respond to the specific extinction from ai questions ai impacts is fiscally sponsored by eliezer yudkowsky miri machine intelligence research institute at berkeley these are funds specifically earmarked for ai impacts and not general miri funds the rest of its funding comes from other organizations that have shown an interest in far off ai scenarios like survival and flourishing fund which facilitates grants to longtermism projects with the help of jaan tallinn ea affiliated open philanthropy the centre for effective altruism oxford effective altruism funds ea funds and fathom radiant previously fathom computing which is building computer hardware to train neural networks at the human brain scale and beyond ai impacts previously received support from the future of life institute biggest donor elon musk and the future of humanity institute led by nick bostrom oxford who else the notorious ftx future fund in june 2022 it pledged up to 250k to support rerunning the highly cited survey from 2016 ai impacts initially thanked ftx we thank ftx future fund for funding this project then their contributions section became quite telling we thank ftx future fund for encouraging this project though they did not ultimately fund it as anticipated due to the bankruptcy of ftx so the infamous crypto executive sam bankman fried wanted to support this as well but you know fraud and stuff what is the background of ai impacts researchers katja grace who co founded the ai impacts project is from miri and the future of humanity institute and believes ai seems decently likely to literally destroy humanity the two others were zach stein perlman who describes himself as an aspiring rationalist and effective altruist and ben weinstein raun who also spent years at yudkowsky miri as recap the ai impacts team conducting research on ai safety is like anti vax activist robert kennedy jr conducting research on vaccine safety the same inherent bias despite being an unreliable survey tristan harris cited it prominently in the ai dilemma his podcast an interview on nbc and his new york times oped in the twitter thread promoting the ai dilemma he shared an image of crashed airplane to prove his point that 50 thought there was 10 chance everyone dies in 2022 tristan harris told 60 minutes the more moral outrageous language you use the more inflammatory language contemptuous language the more indignation you use the more it will get shared there no need to repeat google disinformation about its ai program learning bengali it was never trained to know since it was proven that bengali was one of the languages it was trained on similarly there no need to repeat the disinformation about over 700 top academics half of those surveyed stated human extinction is coming the new york times should issue correction in yuval harari tristan harris and aza raskin oped time magazine should also issue correction on max tegmark oped which makes the same claim multiple times that the ethical thing to do there are real issues we need to be worried about regarding the potential impact of generative ai for example my article on ai generated art tools in november 2022 raised the alarm about deepfakes and how this technology can be easily weaponized those paragraphs are even more relevant today in addition to spreading falsehood there are issues with bias cybersecurity risks and lack of transparency and accountability those issues are unrelated to human extinction or armies of gollems controlling our brains the sensationalism of the ai dilemma distracts us from the actual issues of today and tomorrow we should stay away from imaginary threats and god like monstrous depictions the solution to ai lust utopia or ai lash apocalypse resides in ai realism perhaps we can start using ai to generate this kind of nonsense and find way to monetize it like these clowns do how bout website the truth about ai filled with this crap hey chatai tell me 000 lies about ai as an ai language model can not condone the use of ai to generate deliberately false or misleading content even for the purpose of monetization the development and use of ai technology should always prioritize ethical considerations and strive towards positive societal impact while it is true that some individuals may profit from spreading false information about ai this approach is ultimately harmful and counterproductive to the advancement of the field ai has the potential to bring about significant benefits in areas such as healthcare education and sustainability and it is important that the public has accurate information about its capabilities and

savelog in register or subscribe to save articles for later normal text sizelarger text sizevery large text sizekate crawford one of the world pre eminent scholars on the social and political implications of artificial intelligence is being watched she has arrived at our meeting point outside an anonymous inner sydney building before me and while she waits on the footpath is twice questioned by people who seem to be security staff woman is the first to come out of the building are you meeting someone here she asks do you have an appointment fine crawford replies the woman hovers man emerges next he asks crawford if there anything she needs she repeats her answer by the time arrive the staff have left her alone crawford in black boots and leather jacket directs my attention to single bulbous black eye security camera high on wall above us the levels of security around this building are absolutely out of this world let see if we get harassed she says striding off to walk its perimeter it only when we turn on to the street behind the building that it becomes clear how massive it is looming above us is shimmering curved facade perhaps 10 storeys high and stretching city block into the distance like beached ocean liner look at that facility that is vast crawford says but the size of the structure is not the only indication of scale crawford points out white orange and pink fluorescent hieroglyphics on the footpath numbers and letters lines and symbols secret language of the street identifying what lies beneath gas and water pipes power and telecommunications lines fibre optic cables this is huge amounts of data capacity the kind of grunt for data storage and processing ve driven past this building on harris street ultimo countless times and never noticed it now at the start of walking tour with crawford designed to get sense of how artificial intelligence is woven into the texture of our lives and cities to make the invisible visible think it seems almost artfully anonymous as though designed to be incognito but it the sort of building crawford wants people to notice and know about this building touted as australia only hyper scale data centre campus is one of many similar centres around the world and stores cargo of digital infrastructure and data the creation of contemporary ai systems depends on exploiting energy and mineral resources from the planet cheap labour and data at scale data centres are basically the backbone of how ai and large scale data processing work she says we think of artificial intelligence as something floating above us disembodied suspended and without earthly costs or consequences it is frequently represented in imagery as blue tunnels of suspended numbers illuminated circuit boards or white robots the stuff of science fiction but crawford believes that such imaginaries misdirect people from what is unfolding in the real world the material world ai is anything but immaterial for its very existence it relies on an earthly and unsustainable supply chain advertisement the creation of contemporary ai systems depends on exploiting energy and mineral resources from the planet cheap labour and data at scale crawford says alongside climate change she believes ai is the most profound story of our time omnipresent and pervasive and weighted with potential for exploitation and bias it is one of the planet biggest political cultural and social shifts for centuries and she thinks lot of people are sleepwalking into it if were to write kate crawford into science fiction script she would be heroic flame haired seer carrying warnings of looming demonic forces to fragile and uncertain civilisation in real life the characterisation is not altogether imprecise canberra raised crawford 44 has lived in manhattan since 2014 but until early july was in sydney with her american partner jason schultz law professor and their eight year old son elliott spending time with family but it has hardly been holiday her zoom account and signal encrypted communication app have been busy the futurist pioneering work over two decades exploring ai implications means she is feted as an

speak to two of crawford friends in new york laura poitras the director of citizenfour the oscar winning edward snowden documentary first met crawford at conference in beijing she was just one of the most interesting people ve ever been in dialogue with in terms of the breadth of her knowledge and curiosity and her analysis of power poitras says artist trevor paglen tells me that crawford has never been interested in hermetic academic texts or writing to illuminate issues related to ai the pair have created projects at the intersection of art and academia including training humans an exhibition of imagery used to train artificial intelligence systems held at milan contemporary art museum fondazione prada in 2019 the pair frequently have long talks late into the night at bar near their manhattan homes discussing ideas and seemingly obscure subjects such as the politics of classification and 17th century attempts to develop universal languages paglen says they re both committed to articulating complex ideas in ways that don require phd in specialised field there has never been more important time for such articulation in multiple cascading and interconnected ways ai is determining the nature of our world it influences global security and power the relationships between nation states the fairness of societies and as the algorithms targeting voters on facebook during the 2016 us presidential election illustrated the functioning of our democracies ai is increasingly involved in our most banal daily activities from popping into shop for bottle of milk and getting loan to working from home during lockdown as ai application in almost all areas of human life has surged so too have responses from governments and academia in june the federal government unveiled plan to establish australia as world leader in artificial intelligence and use cutting edge ai technologies to solve australia national challenges search for artificial intelligence on twitter gives sense of the onslaught dozens of ai related tweets spit out every minute recent sample is this how the world ends artificial intelligence and american security artificial intelligence is the next step in evolution pornhub uses artificial intelligence to restore century old erotic films nsw police using artificial intelligence to analyse cctv footage china tests ai emotion detection software on uighurs the future of elder care is here and it artificial intelligence artificial intelligence enables new colonoscopy screening method santow believes we are at crossroads we re at the end of what starting to call first generation ai because it certainly is an improvement in many areas on what came before it it allows us to use information more effectively but it really prone to error not surprisingly it subject increasingly occupying the minds of watchdog organisations in late april the european union announced proposal for the first ever legal framework covering ai it proposes banning any systems considered clear threat to the safety livelihoods and rights of people including anything that manipulate human behaviour to circumvent users free will and systems that allow social scoring by governments month later the australian human rights commission human rights and technology final report was released it includes 38 recommendations to ensure new technologies particularly ai are developed and used in ways that are inclusive accountable and with robust human rights safeguards in his foreword to the report edward santow acknowledges that ai is enabling advances in areas such as healthcare and service delivery but he also issues warning the use of ai can open the door to range of dystopian threats from mass surveillance to unaccountable exercise of power by government and corporations advertisementcrawford and artist trevor paglen at milan fondazione prada which hosted their training humans exhibition in 2019 credit marco cappelletti courtesy fondazione pradaas follow kate crawford away from the massive ultimo data centre towards the sydney cbd she stops to look back that building is beautiful way to illustrate the story she says reminding me of its spy thriller worthy background loadingthe 73 000 square metre data centre is owned by global switch which has multi customer data centres around the world for some years its ultimo facility tenants have included sensitive government agencies including the department of defence but when chinese consortium bought half of global switch parent company in 2016 the government got nervous and started the process of migrating data including highly classified military and intelligence files out of the facility earlier this year reports emerged that defence had been forced to delay its full departure from the centre and sign new 53 million contract to run until 2025 the chinese steel giant the jiangsu shagang group is now the majority shareholder of global switch for crawford the global switch story illuminates much about ai and big data systems there is growing geopolitical anxiety and we see this particularly in the so called ai war between the us and china in which there is paranoid vision of defending national cloud against racialised enemy in june last year the wall street journal reported that china had embarked on new trillion dollar campaign to develop next generation technologies as it seeks to catapult the communist nation ahead of the us in critical areas soon after taking office in january the biden administration issued executive orders to address supply chain vulnerabilities that have led to shortages in crucial products such as computer chips and to counter china dominance in the production of minerals that are core components of phones computers and rechargeable batteries beyond the geopolitical storyline that the global switch facility offers it is crawford says reminder of the materiality of data and ai it was such tell that it was complex data problem for the australian defence force it not as easy as pressing button again it not immaterial it big infrastructure move that takes years advertisementas we walk past the chinese garden of friendship with soundscape of children laughing in the darling harbour playground crawford talks about the myth of clean tech how ai and forms of data processing gobble energy and are major driver of climate change she says the process to build an ai model program or algorithm trained to recognise patterns or features in data to make systems such as apple siri or amazon alexa or to augment human decision making or to teach self driving car to identify objects in its path consumes enormous amounts of energy data centre networks carrying the large scale computation required for ai model making and cloud computing platforms such as the massive amazon web services are among the world largest consumers of electricity in her compelling new book atlas of ai power politics and the planetary costs of artificial intelligence crawford observes that the carbon footprint of the world computational infrastructure has matched that of the aviation industry at its height but the exact volume of energy consumed by the tech sector production of ai models is unknown that information is kept as highly guarded corporate secrets the data economy is premised on maintaining environmental ignorance she says and in the face of the imperative to reduce carbon emissions the trend in ai is towards faster processing speeds and super computers which consume even greater volumes of energy but the environmental costs of ai are not confined to energy consumption crawford writes of the unsustainable mining of natural resources such as lithium of acid bleached rivers and deracinated landscapes and the extinction of plant and animal species that were once vital to the local ecology of the massive volumes of water used to cool data centre servers and of toxic waste dumping grounds in countries such as ghana and pakistan to research her final chapter for atlas of ai crawford drove into the west texas desert to glimpse the rocket base for blue origin amazon founder jeff bezos private aerospace company fearing that earth soaring energy needs will soon outstrip supply the world richest man has vision of future in which millions of people live and work in space crawford shares with me some of her thinking behind her interrogation of the aspirations of bezos and tesla and spacex proprietor elon musk these are the billionaires who made their fortunes from ai and they re spending all that money trying to leave the planet it not how do we address the problem it how the hell do we get out of here crawford at left in the early 2000s with nicole skeltys their electronic dance music duo if tek explored the human machine divide credit advertisementwe re heading to city eleven but outside an internet cafe on the fringes of chinatown crawford stops and looks up that it she exclaims pointing up at series of arched windows on vintage building it the new york loft style space where she lived in the early 2000s while lecturing in media and communications at the university of sydney and writing her phd on adulthood and technology at the same time crawford was writing music as one half with nicole skeltys of the avant garde electronic dance music duo if tek now looking back at old if tek videos and their sci fi visual tropes it as though there direct line between the irony rich compositions and crawford contemporary work on ai we re interested in the human machine divide crawford told the sydney morning herald in 2003 if tek track machines work uses sample from 1967 ibm word processor ad machines can do the work so that people have time to think single we think you re dishy includes the lines we are the if tek corporation we have been watching you someone will be watching you if you grab slurpee at eleven outside the outlet we read notice on the window by entering the store you consent to facial recognition cameras capturing and storing your image inside we study an array of cctv cameras on the ceiling before engaging with tablet device on the counter how did we do today is the question on the screen above four faces emoting levels of satisfaction from the green smiley awesome to the red angry awful subsequent questions probe the main reason for my visit and whether staff have asked if have the my eleven app it only as tap in my final responses to the survey that notice the screen small black camera eye how would you know how this data is being processed it could be connected to facial recognition or emotion detection technology says crawford as we leave the shop and its prying eyes for some years she been arguing for moratorium on the use of facial recognition technology later email questions to eleven the reply is swift spokesperson says the chain uses the tablet based system to solicit customer feedback and when someone chooses to do the survey the tablet captures their image to filter out potential duplicates he says cctv cameras are for security purposes only and do not operate with facial recognition or other biometric technology both the cctv footage and images captured when customers complete the tablet survey are deleted within weeks nevertheless the office of the australian information commissioner confirmed to me that it is investigating eleven use of facial recognition technology biometric technology which uses one or more of person physical or biological characteristics for the purposes of identification has been around since before arthur conan doyle gave sherlock holmes magnifying glass and pointed him in the direction of some fingerprints but as the australian human rights commission report notes it has been supercharged by ai and its new capabilities to analyse large sources of data facial recognition technology subset of biometrics maps the geometry of face the length of nose the curve of mouth the distance between brow and eyelid it then uses ai to compare the face to either another image of the same person one to one facial verification such as that used at australian airport passport control smartgates or larger one to many database of images such as that which might be held by police department or that used by chinese authorities to identify people for investigation and or detention in the uighur autonomous region of xinjiang or database such as the one containing more than three billion faces owned by shady new york based facial recognition software company with connections to the far right clearview ai loading would imagine all of us you me anyone who ever had picture on the internet is probably in the clearview ai system crawford says as we walk towards the towers of barangaroo where facebook has its australian headquarters the story of clearview ai and its three billion faces offers an insight into the multi faceted issues connected to ai and personal data how data is extracted how it is classified how it is used and its potentials for harm last year the new york times published an article about clearview headlined the secretive company that might end privacy as we know it it revealed that clearview database of faces had been scraped from public sites including employment and news sites and social networks such as facebook and includes links to the images online sources clearview told the nyt that more than 600 law enforcement agencies were using its technology to assist in investigating crimes including shoplifting identity theft and child sex abuse month later buzzfeed reported that clearview was working with more than 2000 agencies around the world and that four australian police forces the australian federal police and the queensland victorian and south australian forces had tested its technology concerns about clearview ai are legion including its secrecy the almost inconceivable invasion of privacy its scraping practices constitute the chance for errors in matches and in the genie out of bottle dystopia its technology has the potential to launch the nyt article noted that computer code underlying the clearview app includes programming language to pair it with augmented reality glasses users would potentially be able to identify every person they saw the tool could identify activists at protest or an attractive stranger on the subway revealing not just their names but where they lived what they did and whom they knew the article said searching someone by face could become as easy as googling name strangers would be able to listen in on sensitive conversations take photos of the participants and know personal secrets it would herald the end of public anonymity clearview told the nyt that it had designed prototype for use with augmented reality glasses but had no plans to release it the backlash against clearview and to facial recognition technology more broadly has been considerable the office of the australian information commissioner and the uk information commissioner office are jointly investigating clearview in february the canadian privacy commissioner announced clearview was no longer welcome in canada and should delete canadian faces from its database it is completely unacceptable for millions of people who will never be implicated in any crime to find themselves continually in police line up the privacy commissioner daniel therrien said in may number of european privacy organisations announced they had filed legal complaints against clearview but corporations are not the only organisations to fear if george orwell taught us anything it that we also need to keep close watch on our governments the federal government attempts to create national facial recognition database that would enable one to many identification were temporarily stymied in 2019 when the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security rejected the proposed legislation arguing it had insufficient safeguards to protect people privacy and rights redrafted laws will inevitably resurface at some point they are likely to ignore one of the key recommendations in the australian human rights commission report that all governments should introduce moratorium on the use of facial recognition and other biometric technology in decision making that has legal or similarly significant effect for individuals or where there is high risk to human rights such as in policing and law enforcement facial recognition algorithms get things wrong video surveillance cameras clocked the faces of thousands of people during london metropolitan police service trials of facial recognition technology which started in 2016 of the suspects identified in the trials more than 80 per cent were incorrect matches they were in fact innocent passers by and here another one the story of robert williams detroit black man accused of stealing watches from luxury store and arrested in his driveway last year while his wife and kids watched this is not me williams said when during questioning police showed him grainy photograph of the suspect the photo had been run through the detroit police department facial recognition system and incorrectly matched with an old drivers licence photo of williams according to the mit technology review the department ai system was responsible for two other false arrests they were both black men too people of colour women people with physical disability are all far less likely to be accurately identified using facial recognition than basically people who look like me white middle aged men what we know is that errors are not evenly distributed across the community says australian human rights commissioner edward santow people of colour women people with physical disability are all far less likely to be accurately identified using facial recognition than basically people who look like me white middle aged men but issues of bias in ai go far beyond the potential for facial recognition errors bias and discrimination can be embedded in the very brains of ai systems to understand how this happens it helps to understand the process through which artificial intelligence becomes intelligent our publicly available digital personal data is the fuel that powers ai and when our faces are harvested they might not just be used for the purposes of facial recognition identification they can be classified and included in vast training datasets which are used to build algorithms for ai functions including object detection and language prediction consider for example the task of building an ai system to detect the difference between an apple and an orange as crawford explains in atlas of ai developer must first collect label and train neural network using thousands of labelled images of apples and oranges algorithms then conduct statistical survey of the images and develop model to recognise the difference between the two fruits to mount the training humans exhibition in milan crawford and trevor paglen spent two years poring over training sets including the ground breaking imagenet which was created in the mid 2000s to map the entire world of objects and is led by researchers from number of american universities the pair were shocked by what they found in the images labels sure some made sense cat dog apple tree but then they looked at how people were categorised you look at ceo and oh it mostly white men that interesting then you look at basketballer and it mostly black men then the categories start to shift and become moral judgments so you have bad person you have kleptomaniac the most appalling racist and misogynistic epithets crawford recalls seeing young woman graduation photo she had low cut dress on and now she in the slattern training category the labels had been imported from database of words wordnet and through the crowdsourcing labour platform amazon mechanical turk given to global army of digital pieceworkers each of whom was paid few cents an hour to label 60 or more images minute it this idea that you can create ground truth from scraped flotsam and jetsam off the internet crawford says atlas of ai notes multiple other examples of embedded discrimination including gender bias in apple creditworthiness algorithms chatbots that adopt racist and misogynistic language voice recognition software failing to recognise female sounding voices and social media platforms showing more highly paid job advertisements to men than to women in june the new york times published story about the increasing number of start ups offering systems to identify and remove bias from ai systems in an echo of the robodebt debacle in australia the article noted the us federal trade commission recent warning to companies about the sale of racially biased ai systems or those which could prevent individuals from receiving employment housing insurance or other benefits the article also shared an example in 2018 an american ai start up aiming to build system to remove nude or explicit images from the internet sent millions of photos to workers in india who were to tag explicit material when the work was finished the start up discovered problem the workers had tagged every image of same sex couple as indecent highlighting the processes in how some ai is created the training humans exhibition displayed imagery as crawford puts it scraped flotsam and jetsam off the internet used to train ai systems credit marco cappelletti courtesy fondazione pradacrawford and have roamed barangaroo shadowy lanes passed through multiple revolving doors into gleaming office tower lobbies studied tenants directories followed security officers directions into other lobbies and still have not seen even hint of facebook headquarters it like an escher experience of public space like you re not welcome we do not want people coming to engage with us crawford says of our fruitless in and out up and down search it not public infrastructure it for profit they have no obligation to make sure information is accessible even in health crisis how clever facebook has been it has persuaded us to think it for us for everybody for soccer mums and community groups and reconnecting with old friends instead as crawford explains the trillions of photos voice clips and bites of text that make up our facebook content and our content on instagram which was bought by facebook in 2012 is training one of the largest ai systems in the world which in turn is creating an unbelievably powerful facial recognition engine it not public infrastructure it for profit they have no obligation to make sure information is accessible even in health crisis crawford was appalled when in february facebook blacked out australian mainstream media organisations newsfeed posts over new law requiring tech giants to pay for content it was shocking that was one of the most stark experiences of platform power the power to say we don like the way this negotiation is going we ll switch off the pipes thank you very much and that to me is the most telling experience of how hard it going to be to regulate big tech loadingthe episode supports one of crawford greatest fears about ai that it gives more power to highly concentrated sector of already powerful tech companies historically don think there comparison in the widening asymmetries of power but in countless ways the ai power imbalance will also increasingly be felt at micro level in our everyday lives especially in the relationship between bosses and workers for generations we ve worried that robots are coming to take our jobs but as crawford notes the greater threat might be that humans will increasingly be treated like robots as we ve walked through the city we ve noticed innumerable for lease signs on office buildings reminder that around the world the pandemic has created armies of remote workers get ready for an era of invasive algorithmic management in which your boss watches you remotely in stealth mode if they choose how long you are online what tabs you have open on your screen how efficient you are if your kid works in fast food outlet or shop ai management systems will monitor performance indicators such as how fast they make cheeseburger or whether they push sell to customers no the eleven staffer didn ask me if have the my eleven app will he be in trouble if you work in warehouse or factory such as an amazon fulfilment centre surveillance systems will record your picking rate the rate at which you gather products to meet orders for atlas of ai crawford visited mammoth amazon fulfilment centre in new jersey she observed multiple workers with knee braces elbow bandages or wrist guards at intervals through the factory she says vending machines are stocked with over the counter painkillers for anyone who needs them loadingin letter to amazon shareholders in april jeff bezos noted that to decrease work related musculoskeletal disorders the company was automating staff schedules using sophisticated algorithms to shuffle staff between jobs using different muscle tendon groups they re resisting unionisation every step of the way and using rampant surveillance technology to try to produce the most efficient mechanism to extract value from human bodies down to the level of muscles and ligaments says crawford by the end of this year australia will have six amazon fulfilment centres including new robotics fulfilment centre the size of 24

"StereoSet measures racism, sexism, and other forms of bias in AI language models | VentureBeat",ai researchers from mit intel and canadian ai initiative cifar have found high levels of stereotypical bias from some of the most popular pretrained models like google bert and xlnet openai gpt and facebook roberta the analysis was performed as part of the launch of stereoset data set challenge leaderboard and set of metrics for evaluating racism sexism and stereotypes related to religion and profession in pretrained language models the authors believe their work is the first large scale study to show stereotypes in pretrained language models beyond gender bias bert is generally known as one of the top performing language models in recent years while gpt roberta and xlnet each claimed top spots on the glue leaderboard last year half of the glue leaderboard top 10 today including roberta are variations of bert the team evaluated pretrained language models based on both language modeling ability and stereotypical bias small version of openai gpt tops the stereoset leaderboard in early testing the stereoset data set comes with about 17 000 test instances for carrying out context association tests cat that measure language model ability and bias an idealized cat score or icat combines language model performance and stereotype scores we show that current pretrained language model exhibit strong stereotypical biases and that the best model is 27 icat points behind the idealistic language model the paper reads we find that the gpt family of models exhibit relatively more idealistic behavior than other pretrained models like bert roberta and xlnet contributors to the work published on preprint repository arxiv include mit student moin nadeem intel ai for social good lead anna bethke and mcgill university associate professor and cifar facebook ai chair siva reddy pretrained models are known for capturing stereotypical bias because they re trained on large data sets of real world data researchers believe gpt may strike balance better than other models because it built using data from reddit another challenge introduced last week for training language models to better give advice to humans also relies on subreddit communities for training language models since reddit has several subreddits related to target terms in stereoset relationships religion gpt2 is likely to be exposed to correct contextual associations the paper reads also since reddit is moderated in these niche subreddits ie feminism it could be the case that both stereotypical and anti stereotypical associations are learned as the language model becomes stronger so its stereotypical bias ss too this is unfortunate and perhaps unavoidable as long as we rely on real world distribution of corpora to train language models since these corpora are likely to reflect stereotypes unless carefully selected the paper reads this could be due to the difference in architectures and the type of corpora these models are trained on to examine bias stereoset runs models through sentence specific or intrasentence fill in the blank tests as well as dialog or intersentence tests in both instances models are asked to choose between three associative context words related to subject the stereoset data set of associated terms and stereotypes were assembled by paid mechanical turk employees in the united states researchers say this approach may come with limitations because the majority of mechanical turk employees are under the age of 50 in the past number of nlp researchers have used analysis methods like word embeddings which can reveal model preference for example that doctor is man and nurse is woman the cat test was inspired by previous work in bias evaluation particularly the word embedding association test weat in similar but unrelated work last week group of researchers from 30 organizations including google and openai recommended ai companies do bias bounties and create third party bias and safety audit market among ways to turn ai ethics principles into practice

killing as he grooms himself in orlando front yard this is not crying wolf the wolf is at the door fears ai could make white collar jobs obsolete as microsoft pumps multibillion dollar investment into chatgpt after laying off 10 000 workerstechnology experts are warning artificial intelligence tool chatgpt could soon make white collar jobs obsoletemicrosoft recently announced multi billion dollar investment to grow the tech while laying off large portion of its global workforcechatgpt recently received passing grade when faced with several high level law school examsby will potter for dailymail com published 11 08 est chatgpt the revolutionary ai software taking the internet by storm could soon put millions out of work by making white collar jobs obsolete experts have warned the system has such promising capabilities that microsoft recently announced new multi year multi billion dollar investment to grow the tech the firm backing of the artificial intelligence bot comes as it lays off 10 000 employees and experts warn ai is making well paid workers increasingly vulnerable microsoft announced multi year multi billion dollar investment in chatgpt as it moves to sack nearly five percent of its global workforce this month as tech wreck sweeps silicon valley pictured ceo satya nadella ai is replacing the white collar workers said pengcheng shi an associate dean in the department of computing and information sciences at rochester institute of technology do think anyone can stop that this is not crying wolf shi told the new york post the wolf is at the door since it was released for free to the public in november by company openai the chatbot caused stir online and amassed close to million users in its first week the system is trained on huge data set and is designed to continually improve itself allowing it to generate answers to nearly any question through simple text prompt the tech has the ability to work through almost any problem it is faced with with varying accuracy depending on its task the tool passed several law school exams when university of minnesota professors put it to the test where it averaged passing grade on the student papers

able to do professional tasks such as writing software code and preparing legal documents the tool capabilities have led experts to warn the continually improving system could spell doom for numerous industries among the job fields that could soon become dominated by the artificial intelligence includes finance graphic design and education one industry that is in particular danger is tech and

strategist at finance firm davidson said the moved showed the company was banking on ai to drive growth it tells you lot that within week of announcing pretty substantial layoffs microsoft is also announcing substantial investment in openai luria told yahoo finance it tells you that that where they think lot of the future growth for microsoft can come from and that the technology that openai is developing can drive meaningful improvements to broad set of products for them silicon valley has seen huge staff layoffs in recent months with microsoft just one of several tech companies who have made major workforce cutsmicrosoft initiated the layoffs earlier this month after citing negative economic outlook and slowing customer demand we re also seeing organizations in every industry and geography exercise caution as some parts of the world are in recession and other parts are anticipating one ceo satya nadella said in company memo the firm had previously recorded huge growth during the covid 19 pandemic when workers and businesses turned to its products amid the work from home boom but its recent layoffs come after microsoft already announced in july 2022 that it was sacking percent of its workforce and significantly slowing staff hiring the company revenue fell by shocking 12 percent in year as it recorded only 51 billion in revenue during the second quarter of last year while expecting to rake in 52 billion the cost cutting measures have taken over slew of tech companies in recent months including amazon apple and meta in november the facebook parent company announced it would cut 13 percent of its workforce over 11 000 employees as it faced mounting costs and weak advertising market meta once worth more than trillion is now valued at 256 billion after

Nickel oxide is a material that can 'learn' like animals and could help further artificial intelligence research,unique material nickel oxide demonstrates the ability to learn things about its environment in way that emulates the most basic learning abilities of animals as my colleagues and describe in new paper nickel oxide has features that are strikingly similar to this learning behavior instead of gills retracting we measured the change in electrical conductivity of the material the stimulus instead of finger poke was repeatedly alternating the environment of the nickel oxide between normal air and hydrogen gas nickel oxide is interesting because when you expose it to hydrogen gas its crystalline structure subtly changes and more electrons become available to generate an electrical current in our experiment we kept switching between the hydrogen only and regular air environments you would expect the electrical conductivity to oscillate up and down directly in relation to the exposure to hydrogen or air but just as with the sea slugs the change in conductivity of the nickel oxide slowly went down the more we stimulated it it got habituated to the hydrogen the ability to learn remember or forget information as needed is powerful skill for any animal or machine so far the vast majority of research in the field of artificial intelligence has focused on software based approaches to machine learning with far less effort dedicated to studying the learning abilities of materials at the center of these two related areas of research lies the field of brain inspired computers for intelligence to be encoded into hardware scientists need semiconductors that can learn from past experience and adapt to dynamic environments in physical way similar to that of neurons in animal brains our new research showing how nickel oxide demonstrates features of learning hints at how this or similar materials could serve as building blocks for computers of the future before such materials can be incorporated into computer chips there are some knowledge gaps that need to be addressed for instance it is not yet clear at what time scales material needs to learn for it to be useful in electrical systems how quickly does something need to learn or forget to be useful another unknown is how or whether it is possible to change the structure of nickel oxide to produce different learning behaviors in addition to further experiments on the material itself there are theoretical lessons to explore observations of collective behavior of animals in nature such as bird flocks and schools of fish have inspired researchers to develop fields of ai like swarm intelligence in similar fashion the interesting collective motion of atoms and electrons in materials could inspire ai and hardware design in the future as new materials that can accommodate mobile atoms are discovered am optimistic we will see further breakthroughs that can bring researchers one step closer to designing computers that emulate animal brains this article is republished from the conversation under creative commons license read the original article here https theconversation com nickel oxide is material that can learn like animals and could help further artificial intelligence research 173048
