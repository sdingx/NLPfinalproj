UltraSight Receives CE Mark for Novel Cardiac AI Technology,"at 7:30 am cdt|updated : 1 hour agolandmark achievement paves the way for increased patient access to cardiac imaging and optimized care across europe in 2023barcelona , spain , /prnewswire/ -- ultrasight , an israeli-based digital health pioneer transforming cardiac imaging through the power of artificial intelligence , announced it has obtained a ce mark for its ai guidance software for cardiac ultrasound . today 's milestone comes just ahead of the european society of cardiology ( esc ) congress in barcelona and aligns with its call for action to achieve heart health in europe by 2025.ultrasight ( prnewswire ) ultrasight 's technology allows medical professionals , regardless of their sonography experience , to successfully capture diagnostic quality ultrasound images of the heart . the technology can be used at the point of care , paving the way for more widespread detection of cardiovascular diseases ( cvd ) and improved access to optimized cardiac care across the continent.the novel ai software pairs with point of care ultrasound devices that are currently on the market and provides the operator with real-time instructions on how to capture high quality diagnostic images . the underlying ai neural network predicts the position of the ultrasound probe relative to the heart , based on the ultrasound video stream only , and guides the user on how to maneuver the probe to ensure that the acquired images are of diagnostic quality . `` ultrasight was founded with the intention to apply the power of machine learning in imaging and put the ability to scan patients into the hands of physicians everywhere , '' said davidi vortman , ceo of ultrasight . `` by empowering more medical professionals to accurately scan patients , we will have faster and greater detection of cvd across the continent . this is not only a momentous occasion for ultrasight as a company , but it brings us one step closer to helping the millions of people in europe who suffer from cvd . `` according to the esc1 , there are 113 million people living with cvd in europe today . europe has the highest cvd mortality rate in the world , with approximately four million people succumbing to this disease each year . cvd is the leading cause of death for europeans.ultrasight obtained ce mark after results from a clinical study held at the sheba medical center , israel , validated its technology and confirmed that the software is effective at instructing novice medical professionals to acquire diagnostic-quality cardiac images . the study found that ultrasight ai guidance allowed medical professionals who did not have prior sonography experience to obtain diagnostic quality cardiac images in 100 percent of patients . the study was conducted using the philips lumify ultrasound device . `` many medical residents have entered the healthcare field since the pandemic ; however , being able to provide them with the necessary hands-on training and supervision has become challenging for many european emergency departments looking to adopt point of care ultrasound , '' said prof. salvatore di somma , md , phd , director of emergency medicine and chairman of the postgraduate school of emergency medicine at the department of medical-surgery sciences and translational medicine university of sapienza in rome , italy . `` supporting new ultrasound users with ai guidance , such as ultrasight 's ai guidance software , would increase efficiencies and expedite the learning curve while also reducing the time for obtaining good echocardiographic imaging in the emergency room , opening resources for experienced staff to respond to other acute needs . `` `` point of care ultrasound can be a very useful tool for intensive care unit physicians . some key hemodynamic measurements , such as left ventricular outflow tract velocity time integral ( lvot vti ) , provide invaluable help to guide fluid therapy . however , some physicians are still reluctant to use it because they consider this measurement a competence reserved for advanced ultrasound operators , '' said professor bernard cholley , icu department head at the hôpital européen georges pompidou , paris , france . `` when introduced to ultrasight 's ai guidance software , we were very compelled by the prospect of ai supporting more healthcare providers , including novice ultrasound users , to acquire a cardiac ultrasound view by which the lvot vti can be measured accurately for a reliable measurement and optimized patient care . `` the ultrasight ai guidance software is indicated for use in two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography ( 2d-tte ) for adult patients . it is intended to assist medical professionals in performing cardiac ultrasound scans . ultrasight ai guidance software is an accessory to compatible general-purpose diagnostic ultrasound systems and is intended to be used by medical professionals who have received ultrasight 's training as described in the user manual.the ultrasight software is expected to become available in europe in 2023 ."

Mohammad Hosseini: Should we bring AI into hospitals? Let’s find the middle ground,"recently , two major news stories in the technology world broke out.the first one was about a call by big names in the technology sector to pause the development of artificial intelligence . the second was about the use of large language models , or llms , in health care.that followed a recent interview with openai ceo sam altman , who revealed that chatgpt and other applications based on llms will allow us to “ have medical advice for everybody. ” some technology leaders are calling for pausing ai development altogether while another suggests that we should integrate ai into one of the most vital sectors of the society : namely , health care . if this seems confusing , it is — because both ideas are radical and can be seen as the opposite ends of a spectrum regarding technology . but i think we can find a middle ground . let ’ s take health care , for instance . pausing ai development completely would mean losing out on potential benefits that time-strapped clinicians could use to improve care . that said , as an ethics expert , i can not ignore my responsibility to warn society about the risks and trade-offs of a hurried approach regarding the integration of llms in health care . thanks to openai ’ s newly released gpt4 , which can understand and analyze images , in addition to text , scans and x-rays could be among the collected health data . so what is the middle ground ? whether we like it or not , vital sectors including health care use technologies that collect our data . while we are not even remotely prepared for the integration of llms in health care , pausing their development is not the solution . like other technologies , llms will eventually be integrated into sectors like health care , and so small-scale experiments open up space for reflection and evaluation . tthe middle ground involves cautious experimentation with small-scale llms and evaluating their performance , while observing what their developers will do with our information and trust.instead of pausing ai , we should collectively negotiate with ai developers , demanding good faith and transparency to ensure that technology will not make us vulnerable in the future ."

OPPO Reno7: The Portrait Expert Powered by Cutting-Edge Hardware and Artificial Intelligence | THISDAYLIVE,"oppo nigeria has launched reno 7 , its much anticipated flagship device in nigeria . reno 7 is the first smartphone series to specialize in portrait photography , the oppo reno series has since paved the way for a new generation of smart portrait capabilities with its revolutionary portrait technology and chip-level ai algorithms . with the launch of the new reno7 , oppo nigeria has taken portrait-focused experience to the next level thanks to a combination of professional hardware and algorithms that enable users worldwide to create gorgeous portrait images with just the click of a button . oppo reno7 is also the first smartphone to embed algorithms onto sensor hardware which enables the device to produce sharper , clearer and brighter images . this was achieved after oppo engaged in extensive research in sensor technology in order to deliver the highest quality images to its customers . according to the marketing director , oppo nigeria , iris cao , the new reno 7 comes with innovative features powered by advanced image processing algorithms . among these are bokeh flare portrait , selfie hdr and ai beautification . these features are the result of over 10 years of image technology research and development , as well as the latest success in high-quality portrait photography for smartphones . “ for instance , the ai beautification deliver natural beautification effects for portrait photos and videos on oppo reno7 ’ s rear and front cameras . it also helps to remove blemish , pimples and facial acne on the faces of individuals and produces customized retouching for individuals in group photos ” . our customers would love this phone , she added . in her own words , jennifer okorhi , integrated marketing manager oppo nigeria , said that the reno7 is not just a fashion statement for its stylish and sleek look but a device customers would find very amazing in terms of functionalities . “ this is the era of social media platforms which are replete with stories whether personal , business or service oriented , are usually accompanied by pictures . good pictures help to bring the stories to life and this is one area the reno7 stands out from the rest . it creates great pictures irrespective of low or high lighting backgrounds ” . she said . the phone is available in three colours – sunset orange , auroral blue and cosmic black . oppo has promised to continue its focus on exploring new possibilities in imaging through advancements in both hardware and software , empowering the reno series to bring even more professional portrait photography to users around the world . with the addition of a 2-megapixel microlens on oppo reno7 and support for 16.6x magnification on both video and photos , oppo introduces a new way to experience smartphone photography and maximize your creativity and curiosity . the inclusion of the microlens on oppo reno7 involved more than simply making room for an additional lens on the phone . at the structural level , oppo made the decision to install the microlens module on the back cover of the phone , rather than directly mounting it on the motherboard . as the short focal length of the microlens requires the phone to be placed very close to the objects being photographed , oppo also added a new orbit light underneath the microlens to provide additional illumination to ensure the delivery of image versatility and high shooting performance . bokeh flare portrait on oppo reno7 improves on the previous generation features to deliver more professional-looking dslr-like portraits . oppo ’ s exclusive ai algorithms enhance the brightness of the human subject in images while automatically blurring the background and boosting the bokeh light spots . with just one click , oppo reno7 can capture portrait images with rich bokeh light spots that look just like those taken on high-end dslr cameras . compared to previous generation features , the new bokeh flare portrait delivers a more textured bokeh effect and enhances skin tones , especially in images with high color saturation . this helps portrait subjects to stand out more against backgrounds , making them the clear focus of the image . backlight can be one of the most difficult environments to master when taking photos , but with oppo reno7 ’ s selfie hdr function and the imx709 sensor , it ’ s now easier than ever to happily snap sharper , brighter , and more natural-looking selfies in the presence of strong backlight . although these stunning selfies appear instantly on the screen of oppo reno7 , behind the scenes , various complex algorithms are at work making sure that what the user sees is the best possible selfie image . the hdr algorithm uses multi-frame synthesis technology to suppress highlights and enhance dark details in the image . alongside this , a portrait matting algorithm has been trained on a large database of portrait images to accurately identify human subjects in the image . following this , the bokeh algorithm optimizes image segmentation to reduce false bokeh and ensure that edges between bokeh lights and the background appear natural . further enhancements are then made to the shape and color of the bokeh flares and the brightness and tone of the subject ’ s skin . oppo continues to explore how ai algorithms can be used to meet the different photo retouching needs for users around the world with ai beautification . leveraging machine learning trained on 5,000 unique faces in 400,000 images , ai beautification recognizes 393 key facial feature points to deliver natural beautification effects for portrait photos and videos on oppo reno7 ’ s rear and front cameras . beautification effects include ai blemish removal and customized retouching for individuals in group photos . making use of the oppo image clear engine ( ice ) embedded in oppo reno7 , flash snapshot shoots multi-frame bursts of ultra-short exposure photos to capture crystal clear images even when subjects are moving . simply raising the oppo reno7 and pressing the shutter is all that ’ s needed to capture any moment , anywhere , without worrying about blurry or out of focus images . in addition , the 64mp main camera provides amazing image processing capabilities . the resolution enhancement algorithm can construct higher-resolution images by utilizing sub-pixel displacement between multiple frames to synthesize 108mp extra-hd images using what ’ s known as a vd solution . with oppo reno7 ’ s flash snapshot and ultra-clear 108mp image , amazing photos are on hand anytime and anywhere . about usfounded on january 22 , 1995 , thisday is published by thisday newspapers ltd. , 35 creek

Positive Technology And The Cosmic Mission: How AI Is Helping Humans Achieve States Of High Energy And Success,"annie browncontributoropinions expressed by forbes contributors are their own.aiannie brown is the founder of lips , an ai enabled social commerce platform for women and lgbtq creators . share to facebookshare to twittershare to linkedintrans-humanism is not merely some geeky tech subculture , nor a futuristic daydream , but a pervasive phenomenon that is already impacting our humanness itself . we ’ re talking about the merging of human beings with technology , and not just at the physical level , but possibly a merging that encroaches upon the most intimate dimensions of the soul . and energy is the currency of the soul . without it , stressors can overwhelm you , leaving self-doubt and anxiety in control . but by raising your field of energy , you live an elevated life : one of true transformation , high achievement , and success . stefanie bruns , the founder of business flow academy , believes that states of high energy are paramount in finding fulfillment in life . a psychologist and business mentor for 16 years , bruns has dedicated herself to helping successful people break through their self-limitations and soar to new heights in business . however , with transhumanism comes potential risks to our mental health , and therefore a potential dampening of our vibrational frequency . we have already seen this with the unintended negative impacts of screen-time , social media , and more advancements have on our lives . this is where positive technology comes in . this was the main motivation for the development of a novel research area—positive technology—which aims at investigating how ict-based applications and services can be used to foster positive growth of individuals , groups and institutions . positive technology – or technology designed to improve the quality of our lives – has boomed over the last few years . now we have everything from happiness apps to physiological sensors that detect stress to digital objects that remind you to practice gratitude . through a discussion with bruns , it became clear that while technology , particularly artificial intelligence , is often used to benefit mental health or business success separately , by combining the two use cases . emotion regulation—a person 's ability to effectively manage and respond to an emotional experience—is a key aspect of psycho-social functioning and well-being . how could digital tools be used to support this process ? a study titled , “ new technologies for the understanding , assessment , and intervention of emotion regulation ” addresses this discusses the potential of integrating technologies such as ai-enabled virtual reality , wearable biosensors , smartphones , and biofeedback for improving understanding , assessment , and intervention of emotion regulation . “ every thought , and every action , has a special electromagnetic energy . if you tell yourself or others who you are every day , you will become that person , ” bruns says . she believes that people in any stage of life can fall victim to this . despite a successful career and an abundance of wealth , a lack of guidance can be all that stands between you and greater states beyond high achievement . this is why it is crucial for all business leaders to implement a positive integration of human and technological support . for example , rocky.ai is combining the strengths of a virtual assistant and a leadership coach and brings this together in a soft-skill training application , which is available at all times . in another example , clinical research psychologist dr. alison darcy created woebot , a facebook-integrated computer program that aims to replicate conversations a patient might have with his or her therapist . woebot is a chatbot that resembles an instant messaging service . the digital health technology asks about your mood and thoughts , “ listens ” to how you are feeling , learns about you and offers evidence-based cognitive behavior therapy ( cbt ) tools . if psychology pertains to the connection between our emotions , psychiatry explains their involvement in our biochemical processes . our microbiome has a significant involvement in the biomagnetic field of our body , and every cell needs a special voltage . without the right level of energy , our cells don ’ t have that voltage and fail to operate at their maximum potential . the consequences manifest in all areas of our life , from our emotional regulation and wellbeing to the manner in which we make decisions . bruns believes in the importance of seeing our mind , brain , and energy field as one , but many are unconsciously able to do so . there are definite signs that machine learning , algorithms , and data can be utilized to effectively align these aspects of being in a way that was previously left for us to do on our own . in other words , ai can speed up the process of energy and life enhancement . ai in psychiatry is a general term that implies the use of computerized techniques and algorithms for the diagnosis , prevention , and treatment of mental illnesses , and could be applied similarly to enhance our lives . for example , current approaches for the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders largely rely on physician-patient questionnaires that are most of the time inaccurate and ineffective in providing a reliable assessment of symptoms . bruns explains , “ people are still making unhealthy divisions in their life . often , people repeat and reinforce negative outlooks and behaviors and justify them by saying , ‘ it ’ s only a thought. ’ but however intrusive or untrue it may be , our thoughts still have electromagnetic voltage , ” bruns explains . “ every emotion has a special vibration . if you feel guilt and shame , your vibrational energy is very low . if you feel unconditional love , it ’ s much higher . but you can ’ t access these higher planes of emotional vibration if your body is not in good condition . you can ’ t use antidepressants or wait idly for the problem to go away on its own . you have to step deeper and heal from within to raise your field of energy . then , and only then , will you follow the path of your joy and serve your cosmic mission . ” music is an excellent example of not only the physical manifestations of vibrations , but also evidence of how ai can impact our vibrational levels in the future . studies now repeatedly show that music engages the brain at almost every level . the term for these studies is now referred to as musical neuroscience or cognitive musicology , it is this awareness , amongst others , that this article seeks to uncover , including music 's healing qualities . now that we have uncovered the evolving potential of ai ’ s ability to impact our body and mind ’ s energy vibrations positively , how can these be applied to create physical manifestations such as business success ? the path of your joy is unique to you and you only . but in reaching the destination , many have certain prerequisites in common : fulfillment in one ’ s relationship , an abundance of free time , and a thriving autonomous business . it ’ s a fact : your professional success and your energy levels are intrinsically correlated . bruns remarks of the phenomenon , “ it makes a huge difference to your market if you write copy in a higher zone of your energy . if your level of energy is high , it ’ s infectious , and people will want to be a part of it . they will choose you because it feels right . however , if you post because you feel you have an obligation to do so , it will come from a place of low energy . your audience will feel that , too , ” she explains . how does/would heartmath institute use ai to capture , and analyze data related to 1 ) impact of their services and 2 ) the energy/thoughts/electromagnetic impulses of clients . alignment with one ’ s self is something that many people neglect . but in the pursuit of an elevated life , consider how you nourish your body in all forms : emotionally , mentally , and nutritionally . these small details eventually amount to a much greater picture . bruns discusses these concepts in her free training program , “ crushing your energy identity code , ” which delves into both the importance of hawkins ’ scale of emotion and how it influences your life in lower stages of vibrancy . as bruns explains , after persistent burnout and frustration over a lack of progress , many people ask themselves whether they ’ re even in the right field . they wonder whether their true calling is in something else and consider making a complete pivot . however , when faced with energetic incongruence , changing your career path is merely an escape , not a solution . bruns shares that everything starts with a connection to your real purpose - your cosmic mission . “ the cosmic mission is a vision bigger than yourself . when i ask people what their biggest vision is , i often hear responses alluding to luxury : a bigger house , a nicer car , or life in a warmer country . but i ask them once again - what ’ s your biggest vision ? then , they understand . their eyes light up . your biggest vision , and your ultimate driver , is what you can do for others . we are all on this earth to help in any way we can . to help with something or somebody , ” she explains . bruns believes that if you are connected with your cosmic mission in a way that enriches lives , you ’ ll jump out of bed every morning without wishing the day away . the power of a purpose-filled life allows you to overcome trauma , heighten your energy , live a joyful life , and enrich the world . quantum computers are predicted to be capable of accomplishing things ordinary computers can not , which reminds us of how our brains can achieve things that are still beyond artificial intelligence ."

Building transparency and customer confidence in AI | TechRadar,"are our bank accounts secure ? are our homes secure ? are our phone systems secure ? these are all questions we ask ourselves on a daily basis and despite much wariness around the safety of technology , when we are in need of help about a delivery or service , we , without much question , hand over personal details to chatbots.about the authorryan lester , senior director , customer experience technologies at logmein.chatbots have been designed to make our lives a little easier , with simple verification questions they can answer common customer service inquiries without the need to sit on hold waiting for an agent . but with the rise of gdpr , it is important for organisations to communicate to customers how the data that we provide artificial intelligence ( ai ) driven chatbots is being used and stored . in this new era of chatbot technology and data regulations , businesses need to put themselves under the same scrutiny that customer and regulators will.transparency establishes trustas businesses continue to discover new uses for ai-based technology the topic of ethics and transparency is becoming increasingly popular . most organisations are using this technology to improve the user experience but for every ten examples of tech for good , there will always be someone looking to exploit the technology . for example , using automated chatbots to gather personal customer data and then using it for purposes for which it wasn ’ t initially intended . with this in mind , it ’ s important that those who are using it for the right reasons are effectively communicating their ethical use of the technology . in a recent survey by capgemini research institute , approximately three in five consumers who perceived their ai interactions with a company to be ethical said that they place higher trust in that company , were more likely to talk to others about the positive experience , and are more loyal to that company . by empowering customers and giving them the control and ability to seek recourse through the use of ai and chatbot technology , businesses are more likely to see return trust from their customers . it ’ s equally as important that businesses are communicating with employees about their use of ai and chatbot technology . when the capgemini research institute surveyed employees they found that 44 % have raised concerns about the potentially harmful use of ai systems and 42 % objected to the misuse of personal information by ai systems . in order to tackle and prevent issues , cios and it decision makers should ensure they have a clear code of conduct for ethical ai and that they are transparent about the use of ai in the business . at the end of the day , this technology is designed to be making employees lives easier ! is ai bias getting the better of us ? the growing use of ai for sensitive information including for hiring and healthcare , has stirred great debate around bias and fairness . yet human decision making in these and other domains can also be flawed , shaped by individual and societal biases that are often unconscious . although there are many cases where ai can reduce humans ’ subjective interpretation of data , we must remember that chatbots algorithms derive from public data , including news articles and social media . by using public data without checks and balances , ai can incorporate the worst traits of humanity and end up embodying prejudices of the society.several approaches to enforcing fairness constraints on ai models have emerged but we still have a long way to go . some of this work has focused on processes and methods , such as “ data sheets for data sets ” and “ model cards for model reporting ” which create more transparency about the construction , testing , and intended uses of data sets and ai models . other efforts have focused on the implementation of assessments and audits to check for fairness before systems are deployed and to review them on an ongoing basis . all of these efforts should be accompanied by ongoing education campaigns to foster a better understanding of the strict legal frameworks that accompany the use of ai and the growing availability of tools to improve fairness.again , transparency is essential when it comes to the use of ai and chatbots in customer-facing services . it ’ s vital that businesses understand the limits of ai and are able to communicate in simple terms that ai is not here to fully replace humans . regardless of future developments , ai will always lack the uniquely human trait of emotional intelligence . therefore , for every use of ai there will always be a human operating the controls and customers should feel confident that this will not change.be deliberate with technologyas ai and chatbot technology continues to evolve , industries should prepare for the new challenges and criticisms that will inevitably come with it . businesses shouldn ’ t be scared of this technology , they should be embracing the innovative and exciting opportunities that it presents . ai is a technology that ’ s developing fast , and it won ’ t wait for indecisiveness . businesses need to ensure that they are being deliberate when they use it and transparent with how they use it . if they can do this , customers will place their trust in both you and your chatbot ! keep your passwords safe with the best password manager ."

"Ready or Not, Here Comes AI | Next TV","why this matters : after stops and starts , artificial intelligence technologies now stand poised for a major business breakthrough.as emerging technologies go , artificial intelligence ( ai ) has certainly taken its time in making its presence felt on the world.surprising as that may be , the term ai has actually been around for almost 70 years , having been first coined back in 1955 by computer scientist john mccarthy , a.k.a . the ‘ father of ai ’ , the same year emmett brown invented time travel in the movie back to the future.since then , ai has experienced a largely stop-start existence , principally due to sporadic funding and below-par technology . in truth , the term ai has ( arguably ) gained more notoriety for storylines of killer robots ( and the occasional wall-e ) hell-bent on destroying mankind than for its practical use and business benefits . but that ’ s all changing.the fourth industrial revolutionthanks to breakthroughs in computing power , the advent and availability of big data , cloud hosting/storage , highly sophisticated software , and complex algorithms , the potential of ai is now starting to be fulfilled—with the business world being the biggest benefactors.the market has reacted at pace . in recent years , billions of dollars have been invested by many of—if not all—of the world ’ s leading organizations into ai technologies ( and companies ) , each of them looking to utilize some form of ai technology to future proof and improve their businesses , and/or create a competitive advantagevarious estimates suggest more than $ 46 billion will be spent on ai services by 2020 by businesses , a figure rising to above $ 51 billion 12-months later.where ai will have the greatest and earliest impacte-commercecustomer service ( including call centers ) healthcare ( including lifestyle ) automotivecybersecurityfinancelegalbut what is ai ? before we go on ( for the non-computer scientists out there ) , it ’ s perhaps worth clarifying a few things around what ai is and is not . yes , ai can mean robotics , but the best examples of ai are purely software based rather than having a physical form.there are hundreds , maybe thousands , of often extremely technical and confusing definitions banded around online and in various publications detailing what ai actually provides . indeed , entire books have been written detailing the subject.for a more technical and detailed description we recommend you visit your local library , or download a copy of one from the many ai authors out there—nick bostrom ’ s “ superintelligence : paths , dangers , strategies ” is a personal favorite of mine.in its most simple form , ai is the study of methods for making computers behave intelligently and being able to replicate various characteristics of humans.these can include identifying objects , sounds , understanding languages spoken , reading , and understanding content such as text and numbers.machine learning ( ml ) is another extremely important branch of ai that you 'll often hear and read about . ml uses a more cognitive approach , using algorithms that enable it ( whatever form factor ‘ it ’ may be ) to combine what it ’ s been programmed to do , but also the capability of learning for itself through experience.where we aredepending on what you have seen , heard , or read ( fictional or not ) , you may have different ideas as to what ai is and is not capable of at this stage . to offer some clarity there are three simple levels to be aware of:1. weak aiai capable of demonstrating human intelligence to carry out specific tasks.2 . strong aiai capable of showing self-awareness , the ability to think and make decisions for itself to the same level as a human being.3 . ai super intelligenceai showing superior levels of intelligence to human beings and fully in control of its existence.for now—and for the foreseeable future—only weak ai is currently relevant , so it ’ s time to remove any images of a leathered up , sunglasses wearing arnold schwarzenegger.ai terminologies you need to knowalgorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems . algorithms can perform calculation , data processing , and automated reasoning tasks.chatbot ( also known as a talkbot , chatterbot , bot , im bot , interactive agent , or artificial conversational entity ) is a computer program or an artificial intelligence which conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods . such programs are often designed to convincingly simulate how a human would behave as a conversational partner.deep learning ( also known as deep structured learning or hierarchical learning ) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on learning data representations , as opposed to task-specific algorithms . learning can be supervised , semi-supervised , or unsupervised.a virtual assistant is a software agent that can perform tasks or services for an individual . sometimes the term `` chatbot '' is used to refer to virtual assistants generally or specifically those accessed by online chat ( or in some cases online chat programs that are for entertainment and not useful purposes ) .machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence in the field of computer science that often uses statistical techniques to give computers the ability to `` learn '' ( i.e. , progressively improve performance on a specific task ) with data , without being explicitly programmed.robotics is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering and science that includes mechanical engineering , electronics engineering , computer science , and others . robotics deals with the design , construction , operation , and use of robots , as well as computer systems for their control , sensory feedback , and information processing.speech recognition is the interdisciplinary sub-field of computational linguistics that develops methodologies and technologies that enables the recognition and translation of spoken language into text by computers . it is also known as automatic speech recognition ( asr ) , computer speech recognition or speech to text ( stt ) . it incorporates knowledge and research in the linguistics , computer science , and electrical engineering fields.it ’ s already hereexamples of weak ai have widely been adopted by many different businesses and are in use today—you just might not realize it.in fact , it ’ s a fairly safe bet that you ’ ve already unknowingly encountered some form of ai and machine learning technology before you started reading this article . maybe even before you got out of bed.have you ever used apple ’ s personal assistant , siri ? or google ’ s alexa ? perhaps you ’ ve noticed how your emails can often now detect questions being asked of you and automatically provide you with a readymade short reply ? how about your smart phone that seems to be able to predict sentences you ’ re about to type as you ’ re typing ? for those that like a bit of online shopping ( such as amazon ) or video streaming ( netflix ) , have you ever wondered how those personalized recommendations are determined ? what about facebook and its ability to not only recognize there are people in the photo you ’ ve posted , but can sometimes even identify them , too ? they ’ re all using some form of ai , with the intention of bettering their customer ’ s experience , enhancing their financial opportunities and—unseen externally—improve their efficiency in workplace.ai for all “ we are at the cusp of a new revolution , one that will ultimately transform every organization , every industry , and every public service across the world , ” said ralph haupter , president , microsoft asia . “ i believe 2018 is the year that this will start to become mainstream , to begin to impact many aspects of our lives in a truly ubiquitous and meaningful way. ” you may be forgiven for thinking the implementation of ai is something exclusively for the fortune 500 ’ s of this world ... but you ’ d be wrong . today , things are so advanced that there is unlimited growth potential with ai companies designed to support business like yours.in essence , ai is something that can be packaged up and purchased on a monthly basis , like your broadband or phone . this model reduces significant costs associated with more bespoke in-house solutions.it also means the complexity is significantly removed ( the ‘ it doesn ’ t matter how it works as long as it works ’ approach ) , meaning you won ’ t necessarily need to go and employ a qualified and expensive computer scientist. “ you do n't need to be a mathematics genius or have a phd in software engineering to make sense of ai for your business , ” said gartner analyst whit andrews . “ you do n't have to make massive investments in infrastructure and personnel in order to start applying ai 's potentially transformative technologies. “ these technologies will transform the nature of work and the workplace itself , ” he added . “ machines will be able to carry out more of the tasks done by humans , complement the work that humans do , and even perform some tasks that go beyond what humans can do . as a result , some occupations will decline , others will grow , and many more will change. ” competitive advantageso , why should you and your business consider implementing ai ? could it be just a fad ? will it really benefit you ? the answers are wide , extremely varied , and will be largely unique to your own business . there may be some obvious areas of your business you 'd like to improve upon—be it financially or operationally motivated.the magnitude and inevitability of ai can not be ignored , nor underestimated . many ai experts and professionals have described the potential impact of ai on businesses as being equivalent to the invention an adoption of the personal computer and email.some suggest that ai can help boost revenues by around 20 percent , while others warn that any business currently not at least thinking about adopting some form of ai could already be two years behind a rival . further delays could even result in their demise further down the road due to losing a competitive advantage.do or die “ more than one-third of businesses will not survive the next 10 years , ” said john chambers , the now former ceo of cisco during a discussion on ai . “ companies should not miss the market transition or business model nor underestimate your competitor of the future—not your competitor of the past. ” ovum principle analyst , michael azoff added : “ every business should at a minimum make itself aware of ai progress in its industry. ” getting startedthe first thing to remember is what the purpose of ai actually is and identifying how it can benefit your business . from speaking to various professionals in the field , it can be narrowed down to two core reasons : solving existing problems and discovering/identifying new opportunities.at its core , ai is fueled by data , which can come in many different forms for many different uses . emails , newsletters , subscriptions , views to your website , downloads , and sales are just some examples of where data can be collected.on its own , that data may not seem useful . however , contained within , it could be the difference between success and failure or profit and loss . this is where ai comes into play , and where it would be able to—in many instances—do the job of a human.a famous quote within ai circles comes from michael palmer of the association of national advertisers sums it up well : “ data is just like crude [ oil ] . it ’ s valuable , but , if unrefined , it can not really be used . it has to be changed into gas , plastic , chemicals , etc . to create a valuable entity that drives profitable activity ; data must be broken down and analyzed for it to have value. ” today , the bulk of that potentially valuable data held in companies is still not being utilized . “ if we look at the amount of data which is actually being analyzed today , only 20 percent of the data we have is searchable and being used productively , ” said ibm chairman , president , and ceo ginni rometty during a discussion on the subject . “ the other 80 percent is held inside companies , generally not being used. ” impact on jobsone of the more universal drivers for ai is centered around automation—a word often which spreads fear when discussing the risks to people ’ s professions . areas like administrative work ( such as data processing and data collection ) are widely seen as function where ai will support—or even replace—humans.ai and careersaccording to oxford university , the following professions each have a 99-percent probability of being replaced by computers in the future.data entry keyerslibrary techniciansnew accounts clerksphotographic process workers and processing machine operatorstax preparerscargo and freight agentswatch repairersinsurance underwritersmathematical technicianssewers , handtitle examiners , abstractors , and searcherstelemarketersmeanwhile , the following professions are said to be widely safe from ai replacement.recreational therapistsfirst-line supervisors of mechanics , installers , and repairersemergency management directorsmental health and substance abuse social workersaudiologistsoccupational therapistsorthotists and prosthetistshealthcare social workerssome figures suggest almost half of all activities at work could eventually be automated , while price waterhouse cooper estimates ai powered machines could take up to 30 percent of uk jobs by 2030. the bank of england has estimated that 15 million jobs may be at risk. “ if your work is repetitive and not creative , you will be gone very soon , ” was a stark warning dr. roman v. yampolskiy , a professor in the department of computer engineering and computer science at the speed school of engineering , university of louisville.bart selman , a professor of computer science at cornell university , was quoted as saying : “ a lot of large companies have middle management jobs where people manage other people at a very low-level in terms of keeping track of things like vacations and sick days . those jobs i believe are at risk . jobs that involve a large routine component . if you ’ ve made the proper investment , you can develop an ai system that can take over a good fraction of those jobs . a lot of big companies have a lot of those positions and will be looking at it. ” examples of automation and loss of jobs can be seen all over the world today . some of the headline grabbing stories include that of a japanese law firm , fukoku mutual life , which invested more than $ 1.7 million building an ai platform with ibm watson , has used the technology to replace more than 30 staff members . the annual savings for the firm is predicted to be around $ 1 million a year. “ the next wave of economic dislocation won ’ t come from overseas , ” president barack obama said in 2017 during his farewell address . “ it will come from the relentless pace of automation that makes many good middle-class jobs obsolete. ” spotting an opportunityanother major area for ai adoption is within sales . there are now examples of where ai , using natural language processing software and specific algorithms , is able to spot patterns ( in data ) , to identify new opportunities and provide a level of analysis in just a few seconds.this can vary greatly . examples include gaining greater knowledge on customer ’ s viewing and buying behavior—i.e , what they ’ re looking at and when they most likely buy ( such as pay day ) .another might be identifying the best time to send bespoke marketing and promotional materials or newsletters to specific customers rather than en masse as part of a one-size-fits-all strategy . another could be automatically identifying cold customers that haven ’ t transacted with you for a while and send them updates , reminders , or special offers to help get things over the line.the future of aithese are just a handful of examples of how and where ai is already proving significant benefits and opportunities for businesses all over the world.it ’ s important to realize these are all current technologies , with this article designed to demonstrate and educate you as a businessperson , what is available today , rather the stargazing into the future.the ai revolution is here and it will—if it doesn ’ t already—play a key role in the future of the way your business runs and performs . when you decide to get on board is up to you . i ’ ll leave you with this quote from gartner : “ as

"Riverside University Health System Medical Center, Skymount Medical Begin U.S. Clinical Trial for COVID-19 Oral Therapeutics Discovered Using Artificial Intelligence","first patient study in north america to investigate a new combination of two previously fda-approved drugs identified as effective against covid-19 by deepdrug™ , an artificial intelligence platform developed by louisiana state university ( lsu ) researchers.published : /prnewswire/ -- skymount medical has partnered with riverside university health system ( ruhs ) medical center to conduct the first u.s. clinical trial on the efficacy of covid-19 oral therapeutics discovered by lsu researchers using artificial intelligence ( ai ) . the testing will be conducted through ruhs medical center 's comparative effectiveness & clinical outcomes research center ( cecorc ) in moreno valley . it will evaluate the combined effects of an already fda-approved cancer medication and an already fda-approved anti-parasitic agent ( both approved for humans ) on patients with mild-to-moderate covid-19 symptoms that do not require hospitalization . ( prnewsfoto/skymount medical ) similar studies are already underway in europe . although the outcomes for patients have yet to be revealed , predictive studies leveraged by lsu 's ai technology and early cell and animal studies conducted by illinois institute of technology have already shown the new drug combination up to 97 % effective in reducing the amount of sars-cov-2 , the virus that causes covid-19 . `` we 're excited to partner with ruhs and dr. bruce weng 's team to facilitate a human clinical investigation to try to demonstrate the safety of the drug combination and efficacy in adult patients who have tested positive for covid-19 and exhibit mild-to-moderate symptoms , '' said dr. kishor wasan , skymount medical 's chief medical & scientific officer , distinguished university scholar adjunct professor in the faculty of medicine at the university of british columbia and co-inventor of the therapeutic combination.the study will be a double-blind intervention conducted in an outpatient setting , comparing the two-drug combination to a placebo . the goal of the study is to determine the impact this combination therapy will have on decreasing the length and severity of symptoms without negative side effects . the study will also evaluate if the combination drug can help decrease the need for hospitalizations . the clinical research study has been ruled fda investigational new drug exempt ( fda-ind exempt ) by the local institutional review board ( irb ) .dr . weng , an infectious disease physician at ruhs medical center , will inform patients diagnosed with covid-19 about the study , and invite them to participate . patients will be screened , enrolled , and have subsequent follow up visits in the ruhs emergency department . `` unfortunately , california has its fair share of covid-19 cases , '' dr. weng said . `` the one silver lining in this is that the sample size at our hospital is substantial enough to produce valuable data when evaluating the safety and efficacy of this drug combination . this is a pilot study and 100 % voluntary . the safety of our patients is paramount , and we will stay in constant contact with those choosing to participate to ensure their health and well-being . `` the researchers are hopeful that the new therapeutic also will prevent lingering symptoms , which some people experience following covid-19 . `` the drug combination may reduce long-haul syndrome , the long-term consequences some patients report even after recovering from covid-19 , such as mental health issues and damage to organs , '' dr. wasan said.deepdrug™ , the ai platform that helped discover the oral therapeutic , was created by an interdisciplinary team of lsu researchers led by dr. supratik mukhopadhyay , associate professor in the lsu department of computer science . deepdrug™ uses a next-generation ai capability that reduces the time and cost of drug discovery by up to 90 % . `` it 's very gratifying to see this medication enter into the human study phase , '' dr. mukhopadhyay said . `` the fact that we are at this stage so quickly is due to skymount medical 's vast professional medical network and our deepdrug™ platform , which was able to identify this particular combination of medications in a fraction of the time that traditional research takes . `` if skymount medical 's oral therapeutic for covid-19 receives final approval , the company intends to make the treatment widely available and cost-effective.about skymount medicalskymount medical 's mission is to accelerate

What is artificial intelligence and how can it help your DevOps practices today? | TechRadar,"by combining the roles of software development and it operations , devops ( opens in new tab ) often encompasses so many tools and skills that too many of us get stuck working in a complex and time-consuming environment . time that could be spent solving problems gets wasted on mundane tasks . by using artificial intelligence ( ai ) , devops can automate complicated tasks that are easy for computers but hard ( or boring ) for humans . ai can also help streamline processes across the software development lifecycle ( sdlc ) , allowing devops to focus on the work itself . in this guide , we cover how ai can be used throughout the devops cycle to improve productivity and security . what is artificial intelligence ? ai is the theory and method of creating computer systems that can automatically perform tasks normally requiring human , or greater , levels of intelligence . computers rely on complex algorithms to perform these tasks , sometimes through explicit rules being provided to them , but more commonly through what is known as machine learning ( ml ) .ml is a subset of ai , where the system uses statistical methods to learn without explicit directions from a human operator . this requires sets of training data to teach the system desired outcomes . from there , ml can infer things about new data.you may be using ai in your devops practices already—for example , tools that make automatic code suggestions when writing software . the range and scope of devops tools available are growing , and ai is predicted to be a big part of automation in the coming year ( opens in new tab ) .smarter automationusing automation to manage processes is a vital part of the devops approach . however , without ai , automation only executes actions based on explicit instructions provided by a person . ai uses a broader ruleset and a capacity to learn to improve performance over time . this allows ai—and most commonly , ml—to automatically perform complex tasks and eliminate the need for human intervention . these tasks include : requirements analysis—natural language processing ( nlp ) is a type of ml that understands the written word . this ensures that the scope of a project can be explicitly defined.software testing—ml can make sense of the data produced during regression , functional , and user-acceptance testing . it can even be used to automate the creation of tests in the first place . this makes it easier to discover poorly written code and other issues , automating a critical part of the software development cycle.problem-solving—ai can trace the root cause of a problem , while an overworked developer may fix an issue without investigating and solving a deeper underlying problem . security—ai can be used to differentiate between normal and abnormal conditions . this could include spotting unusual activity on a network that may be indicative of unauthorized users gaining access to the network.monitoring and alerts—dealing with the noise of thousands of emails , slack notifications , and other alerts each day makes it easy to miss important issues . ai can make the devops process less noisy by determining which alerts require human intervention and prioritizing issues accordingly . this could entail raising the issue with the correct person , automatically addressing the problem without human intervention , or , in cases where no action needs to be taken , simply ignoring the notification.in each of these cases , ai is used to perform actions automatically that can reduce the workload of devops . this is great in theory , but how does it shape up in practice ? intelligent devops toolsthe most mature ai uses in devops are in applications that help programmers write code more effectively , those which manage monitoring and alerting , and those concerned with cybersecurity . github copilot ( opens in new tab ) and amazon codewhisperer ( opens in new tab ) are ml-powered tools that make relevant code suggestions to speed up programming . both github and amazon integrate additional tools for testing within their environments . not every notification is important , and pagerduty ( opens in new tab ) is an incident response platform that uses ml to minimize interruptions by improving the signal-to-noise ratio of important events to routine ones . as a basic example , instead of receiving alerts each time a service has successfully shut down and restarted , you might only receive an email if the service fails to restart . pagerduty claims to provide up to 98 % alert reduction.both fortinet ( opens in new tab ) and perimeter 81 ( opens in new tab ) provide high-performance network security tools that leverage ai . fortinet provides resources for devops professionals , including github repositories ( opens in new tab ) of tools and scripts to make setup and management of the software easier.for those managing larger numbers of microservices or containers , especially in a multi-cloud or hybrid-cloud environment , dynatrace ( opens in new tab ) uses ai to map , simplify , and manage the devops processes and delivery pipeline.if you ’ re interested in adding ai to your devops workflow , you probably already recognize many of the best devops tools ( opens in new tab ) available . many of the tools that you already use are either adopting ai , or some , such as selenium ( opens in new tab ) , have additional software ( opens in new tab ) or plugins ( opens in new tab ) that allow ai to be integrated into them . keeping on top of developments with the software you already use , and searching for tools that integrate with them , is a great way to get started with ai.conclusionthe devops culture has become an integral part of software development precisely because it allows projects to scale easily : spinning up 1,000 web servers is now as simple as creating one . artificial intelligence takes the process one step further , allowing ever more complicated tasks to be left under the control of computer systems that learn and improve . by using tools such as github copilot , fortinet , and pagerduty , devops professionals can harness the power of ai to produce a more efficient and secure sdlc . while there are many myths around devops ( opens in new tab ) trends , there is no doubt ai will continue to transform devops practices over the next couple of years . techradar created this content as part of a paid partnership with pagerduty . the contents of this article are entirely independent and solely reflect the editorial opinion of techradar . most popularmost shared1i saved 85 % on three years of xbox game pass ultimate – here 's how you can too2disney is set to rescue another neil gaiman project from development hell3galaxy s22 ultra is surprisingly popular , and samsung may cancel a phone to prioritize it4the worst marvel movie is reportedly getting a sequel5portable air conditioners are , not surprisingly , popular right now – but should you buy one ?

Escaping the Singularity: Why Artificial Intelligence Will Not Save the Planet | Yemen Watch,"artificial intelligence has been touted as the next frontier in technological innovation by the world ’ s brightest minds and celebrity ceos like elon musk , who predict a hyper-connected future where big data , smart infrastructure , and biology all fuse into what ‘ futurist ’ ray kurzweil and others call the technological singularity . as we move into the second decade of the twenty-first century , the ideas kurzweil brought into the mainstream are being aggressively pursued by big tech outfits like google , which currently employs the author as a director of engineering , and have been enthusiastically embraced by important sectors of the global economy . reflecting this trend , the national artificial intelligence initiative act ( naiia ) became law on the first day of 2021 , officially bringing the full power of the u.s. government to bear through the national science foundation ( nsf ) , national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) and the department of energy , whose already considerable spending on ai research and development has now been codified into law . the passage of the bill follows a pattern begun in the reagan years , when the republican icon signed national security decision directive nsdd 145 making intellectual property a matter of national security , effectively opening a backdoor to america ’ s largest corporations like ibm and pfizer to shield their commercial interests behind the full might of the u.s. federal government . the naiia is a continuation of the undeniable symbiosis between government and corporate america , who are together leading us into kurzweil ’ s ai dystopia , cloaked behind pseudo-environmental marketing devices like the “ green economy ” or “ sustainable development ” on the commercial end and tired concepts of technological primacy vis-à-vis china on the geopolitical end . but , scientists and researchers are finding out the true cost ai will have on the planet , belying the claims made by the captains of industry and owners of capital who are moving full steam ahead in their campaign to implement an ai-driven socio-economic paradigm , which is at once designed to rid them of troublesome and expensive human labor while , at the same time , rescuing a mortally wounded capitalist system . experts are warning that the risks to the environment as a result of ai and related emergent technologies , such as the internet of things ( iot ) and machine learning systems , are simply not worth it . roy schwartz of the allen institute for artificial intelligence characterized the conclusions of the as “ shocking ” and stated that “ the larger you make these models , the more energy they consume ” , cautioning that if we continue on this trajectory , “ we will see a much more significant negative impact on the environment ” . schwartz stresses that such massive energy consumption doesn ’ t stop at the stage of ai training and that it is practically impossible to quantify how much energy will be consumed across the world by ai models running in different countries and urged better use of data to substantially reduce energy consumption . the explosive growth of the technology sector and all of its gadgets in tandem with the illusion of achieving a technological singularity through a digitally interconnected planet only pushes us further into ecological catastrophe . a true renewable energy paradigm and reduction in co2 emissions can not come through an economic paradigm predicated on consumption and waste . it requires a culture of conservation and localized subsistence , which the proponents of the singularity have no intention of abiding . as more details of the apparent conspiracy headed by president donald trump to storm the u.s. capitol building and prevent the electoral college certification ... as more details of the apparent conspiracy headed by president donald trump to storm the u.s. capitol building and prevent the electoral college certification ... artificial intelligence has been touted as the next frontier in technological innovation by the world ’ s brightest minds and celebrity ceos like elon musk , who ..."

Chinese supercomputer and American doctors clash over AI coronavirus diagnosis of young US vaper,"a patient at a us hospital in july or august last year may have had coronavirus , concluded a chinese supercomputer given the task of diagnosing covid-19 . us doctors said the symptoms were possibly associated with vaping . photo : nora tam a supercomputer in china found that a young vaper in hospital for a “ mysterious pneumonia ” in the united states last summer could be a victim of coronavirus . the tianhe-1 machine detected distinguished features – suggesting high probability of covid-19 – in the cat image of a patient who became severely ill between july and august in north carolina , according to a diagnosis report seen by the south china morning post . the machine is at the national supercomputer centre in tianjin . “ the image shows features of covid-19 , and a comprehensive diagnosis is recommended in combination with epidemiological information and other clinical characteristics , ” said the report generated by artificial intelligence . all patients survived and their cases were added by the us cdc into a pool of hundreds of patients “ potentially associated with vaping ” , or the smoking of electronic cigarettes , that occurred last year . vaping has increased rapidly in the us in recent years . the chinese supercomputer could have made a mistake , according to davidson , because the features it identified in the cat images were not unique at all . dr francis collins , director of the us national institutes of health , said one possible scenario was that the new coronavirus crossed from animals into humans years ago before it became capable of causing the human disease . “ then , as a result of gradual evolutionary changes over years or perhaps decades , the virus eventually gained the ability to spread from human to human and cause serious , often life-threatening disease , ” he wrote in an article posted on the institute ’ s website last month . china has made large-scale use of artificial intelligence technology to help doctors identify coronavirus patients . these systems have reached accuracy as high as 96 per cent and were used to correct false negative test results that happened often to oral swabs , according to scientists involved in the projects . the doctor said ai was accurate and fast and “ improved day by day ” . however , she added that ai could also make mistakes so humans should make final decisions ."

( bloomberg ) -- some early adopters are already experimenting with the generative ai program chatgpt at the office . in seconds , consultants are conjuring decks and memos , marketers are cranking out fresh copy and software engineers are debugging code.almost 30 % of the nearly 4,500 professionals surveyed this month by fishbowl , a social platform owned by employer review site glassdoor , said that they ’ ve already used openai ’ s chatgpt or another artificial intelligence program in their work . respondents include employees at amazon , bank of america , jpmorgan , google , twitter and meta . the chatbot uses generative ai to spit out human-like responses to prompts in seconds , but because it ’ s been trained on information publicly available from the internet , books and wikipedia , the answers aren ’ t always accurate . while chatgpt set certain corners of the internet ablaze when it launched for public use in november , awareness is still filtering out to the broader public . experts anticipate that this kind of ai will be transformative : chatgpt will become the “ calculator for writing , ” says one top stanford university economist . microsoft is in talks with openai about investing as much as $ 10 billion . the software giant is also looking to integrate gpt , the language model that underlies chatgpt , into its widely-used teams and office software . if that happens , ai tech may very well be brought into the mainstream.marketing professionals have been particularly keen to test-drive the tool : 37 % said they ’ ve used ai at work . tech workers weren ’ t far behind , at 35 % . consultants followed with 30 % . many are using the technology to draft emails , generate ideas , write and troubleshoot bits of code and summarize research or meeting notes . ceos are using chatgpt to brainstorm and compose their emails , too . “ anybody who doesn ’ t use this will shortly be at a severe disadvantage . like , shortly . like , very soon , ” said jeff maggioncalda , chief executive of online learning platform coursera told cnn . “ i ’ m just thinking about my cognitive ability with this tool . versus before , it ’ s a lot higher , and my efficiency and productivity is way higher. ” the speed and versatility of the tool has dazzled many users . “ i discovered chatgpt about a month ago , ” one person who identified themselves as a chief executive officer posted on fishbowl . “ i use it every day . it has changed my life . and my staffing plan for 2023. ” read more : is chatgpt an eloquent robot or a misinformation machine ? some are even leaning on it as a crutch : one newly hired product manager at a fintech firm asked for advice on fishbowl , saying they were “ 100 % lost ” in their new role . “ fake it till you make it like you did the interview . when in doubt , ask chatgpt , ” came the reply.amid the excitement , researchers have sounded notes of caution.while much of the anxiety has concentrated on what chatgpt means in education — new york city public schools have banned its use — experts say companies need to think through their policies for the new tool sooner rather than later . if they don ’ t , they risk some of the pitfalls chatgpt and other ai models can introduce , like factual errors , copyright infringement and leaks of sensitive company information.the tech is here to stay , though , and will likely become ever-more pervasive . many ai-assisted programs already exist , and with openai set to release the api , or application programming interface , the number of specialized applications built on the tool will multiply.while some professionals aren ’ t sold on the practicality of the use cases or quality of the output , others are convinced workers are only a few years away from being supplanted by the technology . “ if chatgpt starts making slides , i am done for , ” one deloitte employee wrote .

Italian Garante bans Chat GPT from processing personal data of Italian data subjects | Data Protection Report,", the italian data protection authority ( garante per la protezione dei dati personali ) ( the garante ) ordered the us company open ai llc to temporarily stop chatgpt ’ s processing of personal data relating to individuals located in italy , pending the outcome of the garante ’ s investigation into the privacy practices of chatgpt . the alleged gdpr infringements : the garante apparently took its action after becoming aware of a recent data breach at chatgpt , where users ’ chat titles and payment information was exposed . this led to the garante seeking further information from open ai and noting the following alleged gdpr violations : a failure to provide the required transparency information about chatgpt ’ s processing of their personal data to users and other data subjects whose data is collected by chatgpt ; this is the first action of its kind taken by a data protection authority in the eu in relation to the data processing by the popular generative ai tool , and it deals in particular the hot topic of data processing in the context of “ training ” of machine learning software . the order by the garante does not elaborate specifically on organisations ’ ability to rely on legitimate interests for the collection and use of personal data by the ai engine for training purposes . the interim measure also does not draw a distinction between using personal data to build or train an algorithmic model versus actually inputting personal data into a developed given algorithmic model nor the impact of this distinction on the “ balancing test ” that must be undertaken when relying on legitimate interests . the garante ’ s view on these matters will hopefully become clear following its investigation . this is , however , not the first order by the italian dpa in relation to ai more generally , as in february 2023 the regulator issued a measure preventing the app replika , a chat-bot acting as a “ virtual friend ” to users , from processing personal data of individuals resident in italy . the garante ’ s action is the most headline grabbing action by a data protection authority in the ai space to date because of its impact on chatgpt , which is reportedly the fastest growing consumer application in history . however , it is reflective of the recent increased focus by european data protection authorities on ai , with the dutch , french , spanish and uk regulators all increasing their oversight of ai and publishing materials in this area . about more than a news source , the data protection report provides thought leadership on emerging privacy , data protection and cybersecurity issues , and helps its readers proactively address risks and anticipate next steps in this crucial emerging field ."

Tech leaders urge a pause in the 'out-of-control' artificial intelligence race,"apthe openai logo is seen on a mobile phone in front of a computer screen displaying output from chatgpt on march 21 , in boston . a group of prominent computer scientists and other tech industry notables are calling for a 6-month pause to consider the risks of powerful artificial intelligence technology . that 's the conclusion of a group of prominent computer scientists and other tech industry notables such as elon musk and apple co-founder steve wozniak who are calling for a 6-month pause to consider the risks . their petition published wednesday is a response to san francisco startup openai 's recent release of gpt-4 , a more advanced successor to its widely used ai chatbot chatgpt that helped spark a race among tech giants microsoft and google to unveil similar applications . the letter warns that ai systems with `` human-competitive intelligence can pose profound risks to society and humanity '' — from flooding the internet with disinformation and automating away jobs to more catastrophic future risks out of the realms of science fiction . it says `` recent months have seen ai labs locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one – not even their creators – can understand , predict , or reliably control . '' `` we call on all ai labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of ai systems more powerful than gpt-4 , '' the letter says . `` this pause should be public and verifiable , and include all key actors . if such a pause can not be enacted quickly , governments should step in and institute a moratorium . '' `` a pause is a good idea , but the letter is vague and does n't take the regulatory problems seriously , '' says james grimmelmann , a cornell university professor of digital and information law . `` it is also deeply hypocritical for elon musk to sign on given how hard tesla has fought against accountability for the defective ai in its self-driving cars . '' gary marcus , a new york university professor emeritus who signed the letter , said in a blog post that he disagrees with others who are worried about the near-term prospect of intelligent machines so smart they can self-improve themselves beyond humanity 's control . what he 's more worried about is `` mediocre ai '' that 's widely deployed , including by criminals or terrorists to trick people or spread dangerous misinformation ."
What's Next in AI – Gadget,"as ai continues to mature , nations around the globe – especially in africa – should rely on it more than ever to drive large-scale transformation and competitiveness . from agriculture and remote health services to translating languages , ai can play an important role in helping africa tackle economic problems . the series will cover emerging ai topics including neurosymbolic ai , trustworthy ai and learning and reasoning for language understanding . leading ai researchers from four ibm research labs in new york , haifa , johannesburg and nairobi will present their work . academic courses and other educational programs dedicated to teaching machine learning have sprouted in response to increasing demand . and many globally trained african experts in ai are now returning home . as for ibm research , in late 2012 we opened our first african office in nairobi . then we added another one in johannesburg , south africa , in 2015. it ’ s part of a 10-year governmental agreement with the south african department of trade and industry , aiming to step up investment in the country ’ s information and communications technology infrastructure and boost training . ibm research africa invites all academics , students , developers , researchers and ai practitioners to join the conversation on the future of ai and the role of the african computing community in inventing ‘ what ’ s next for ai ’ in africa . academic experts from top african universities will also give keynote talks on the development of ai in africa . please correct the marked field ( s ) below . sign up to our newsletter get the latest news delivered to your inbox every day . 1 , true,6 , contact email,2 1 , false,1 , first name,2 1 , false,1 , last name,2 gadget - the magazine of personal technology"
Evolving Customer Support with AI and Machine Learning | SAP News,"andreas heckmann is executive vice president and part of the global leadership team at sap , as well as the head of customer solution support and innovation . in this interview , heckmann shares insight into his team ’ s plans to further leverage artificial intelligence ( ai ) and machine learning capabilities . a : the customer has always been at the center of what we do here at sap , whether it involves customizing a product or service to meet their needs or delivering support in a way that accommodates their evolving business models . and while providing superior customer experience has always been our focus , we are constantly looking at ways in which we can enhance this – both in the way we ’ re internally organized and in how we ’ re integrating emerging technologies such as ai and machine learning into our next-generation support services and real-time support channels . by bringing our support and engineering teams together under one umbrella , we are working together behind the scenes to help and support our customers ’ mission-critical business processes . these are the processes that are truly critical on several counts . they need to be leading-edge to differentiate their business model and they need to be constantly available to protect their business . by integrating innovation services , we can also provide all our customers with specific innovations tailored to their business and industry . this approach is allowing us to truly meet our customers where they are and where they want to be in the future . in the support and services industry , engagement is typically initiated by the customer . but nowadays , customers expect to hear from us first and rely on a constant stream of communication to help address any issues they may have – and even those they don ’ t anticipate having . this involves flipping the engagement model and reaching out to our customers proactively before they even face a problem . we ’ ve already seen great success in this by leveraging ai and machine learning technologies across functionalities and solutions within product support . while many of our processes are already automated , we ’ ve added a lot of intelligence to accelerate these and make them more accurate . this intelligence kicks in from the moment our customers first interact with us , whereby we ’ ve created algorithms that automatically triage our support tickets . and while automation has played a huge role in customer support , it ’ s no longer just about automation but now about avoidance and prediction . we want to move toward a world that is self-healing . our vision here is to shield our customers from facing any issues and to minimize the frequency of which they have to reach out to us . to do this , we need to take a lot more data into account . this will be in compliance with all respective laws and data privacy standards and anonymizing data where necessary or requested . with these data analytics , we ’ ll be able to anticipate questions , predict when our customers might face issues , and proactively engage them . while many of our support solutions already leverage ai and machine learning technologies , over the past year we ’ ve focused on integrating new , automated , and interactive features that provide our customers with the tailored solutions they need . we want to simplify and enhance the customer support experience so they can receive the answers they need faster . with incident solution matching , customers can now refine the results by reviewing the key elements suggested , driving them to relevant answers to their technical questions faster . the models continue to improve by collecting this interaction data and integrating machine learning capabilities . we ’ ve also now made this service available to our sap ariba customers , which will continue to allow the platform to improve as it collects more data on various incidents . our real-time support channels – expert chat and schedule an expert – are also based on a foundation of ai and machine learning capabilities , which help equip our engineers with the relevant information they need to provide our customers with targeted recommendations . we ’ ve recently introduced schedule a manager , which allows customers with high-priority incidents that meet certain business requirements to speak directly to a relevant product support manager . as we look toward our customers ’ evolving needs and the future of their businesses , we want to make sure we ’ re one step ahead and can engage them in a way that is both meaningful and inspiring . i ’ m excited for the opportunities these enhancements will bring to both our customers and our employees ."

Colorado lawmakers look to AI to detect wildfires earlier,"nation & worldby jesse bedayn , associated pressupdated 9 minutes agoa bill introduced in the colorado legislature would create a $ 2 million pilot program to use cameras , likely with artificial intelligence technology , in high-risk locations to help identify fires before they burn out of controldenver ( ap ) — a year after the most destructive wildfire in the state 's history scorched nearly 1,100 homes , colorado lawmakers are considering joining other western states by adopting artificial intelligence in the hopes of detecting blazes before they burn out of control.a proposal that legislators will discuss in a hearing thursday would create a $ 2 million pilot program to station cameras on mountaintops in high-risk locations . an artificial intelligence program developed by a private company would analyze the images from cameras with 10-mile ( about 16-kilometer ) radiuses with the aim of detecting something that could signal the start of a blaze.it is part of an ongoing effort by firefighters to use new technology to become smarter about how they prepare and better position their resources . fire lookout towers once staffed by humans have largely been replaced by cameras in remote areas , many of them in high-definition and armed with artificial intelligence to discern a smoke plume from morning fog.there are hundreds of such cameras scattered across california , nevada and oregon , and even casual viewers can remotely watch wildfires in real time.a historic drought and recent heat waves tied to climate change have made wildfires harder to fight in the american west and scientists say warming weather will continue to make fires more frequent and destructive.record-breaking storms that drenched california with more than 11 inches of rain in recent weeks and big snow dumps in other states have improved conditions in the short-term , but the drought persists across most of nevada , california and utah , and large areas of other western states , according to a tuesday report from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration.the goal of the colorado program would be for cameras and an ai algorithm to detect a plume of smoke and alert first responders who can stomp out the conflagration before it grows , said don coram , a former republican colorado state senator who first backed the idea and encouraged this year 's sponsor , rep. cleave simpson , a republican and rancher. “ once these fires get into cresting in the tree tops , it ’ s going to take a lot of resources , a lot of manpower , and a lot of good luck to knock them down , '' coram said.thursday 's hearing will include testimony from a ai wildfire detection company called pano ai . the company began working with cities , including the ski resort town of aspen , colorado , and has expanded to cities and counties in six states.their stations include two cameras mounted on a high vantage point , rotating at 360 degrees and connected to the company 's ai software . each station costs roughly $ 50,000 every year.arvind satyam , the chief commercial officer at pano ai , said that the artificial intelligence uses a data set of over 300 million images that teaches it what is smoke billowing up from a fire and what isn ’ t.once a camera signals that there could be a fire , the photos and information are run through the company ’ s intelligence center for human vetting — the algorithm could ’ ve mistaken a tractor ’ s dust cloud or even geyser for a pillar of smoke — before it ’ s sent along to fire agencies , he said . satyam added that the benefits go beyond detection , allowing fire agencies to pinpoint a blaze 's location and monitor a live feed of the burn.ai has gained notoriety for breaking into a number of fields — from creating propaganda and disinformation to writing essays or cover letters about whatever the user requests.david blankinship , senior technology advisor for the western fire chiefs association , said fire agencies have come to rely on this type of detection technology , especially in california where the programs have been put to wider use . `` it loops around in a 360 all the time and searching for pixel changes that the human eye might not detect , '' said blankinship , adding that “ anything you can do to take time out of the response to that fire saves lives . `` still , blankinship noted that “ these cameras , even with ai , are only one component of the actual solution that is working . `` that solution includes civilians calling in fires , other equipment such as smoke sensors , aircrafts that gather detailed information by flying over the burns , and even satellites providing broader information on a fire 's size , blankinship said.all those systems , including cameras fitted with ai , allow fire authorities to model a wildfire and consequently better make difficult decisions about where and when to evacuate , how many engines to dedicated to a certain fire , or if burns should be extinguished at all.to coram , who will be attending the hearing on thursday , the bill “ just makes too much sense not to do . `` “ i look around at all the rooftops that i can see , and think , ‘ my god , when this catches on fire , what are we going to do ? ’ ” said coram.___jesse bedayn is a corps member for the associated

COVID-19 impact on The Global AI in Agriculture Market 2019 : In- Depth Analysis by blueweave consulting – Science In Me,"according to blueweave consulting , the global ai in agriculture market is projected to reach the valuation of us $ 3013 million by the year 2026 by growing at a cagr of 21.6 % . this can be attributed to factors such as rising demand for agricultural production , increased adoption of advanced technologies and smart sensors , rapid demand for drones in farms , and increased need for monitoring of livestock . using ai in agriculture provides various focal points , such as maximizing product yields using machine learning and image recognition methods . for example , the international crops research institute for semi-arid tropics ( icrisat ) partnered with microsoft to develop an ai-based sowing app that sends sowing alerts to ranchers indicating the following date . earlier technological innovations and the modernization of gps make ranchers and agricultural specialist cooperatives expect that further changes would increase profitability . for example , in addition to the present non-military benefits offered by gps , nations are preparing to upgrade a second and a third signal on gps satellites . this execution of new flags will improve the quality and , in addition , the ability of farming activities , and in the coming years will increase the overall productivity . driverless tractor is a technological development as these tractors can automatically steer using gps-based technology , raise tools from the ground , identify a farm ’ s boundaries and can be remotely operated using a smartphone . a smaller fleet of automated tractors could increase farmers ‘ incomes by more than 10 per cent and increased farm labor costs . the market is driven by a rise in the adoption of cattle face recognition technology . through applying advanced metrics including facial recognition systems for cattle and image classification combined with body condition score and feeding habits , dairy farms are now able to monitor all behavioral factors in a cattle group individually . increasing use of unmanned aerial vehicles ( uavs ) across agricultural farms is driving the market as the use of drones in the agricultural industry can be used in crop field scanning with compact multi-spectral imaging sensors , gps map production through on-board cameras , heavy payload transport and monitoring of livestock with thermal camera-equipped drones , which increases the demand for uavs . drones fitted with hyperspectral , multispectral , or thermal sensors can locate areas that require irrigation changes . when crops have begun to develop , these sensors can measure their vegetation index and health indicator via ai by measuring the heat signature of the crop . as the global population is projected to exceed xx billion by 2050 , it is expected that agricultural consumption will increase by a massive ratio , where drones have now been mainstreamed for smart farming to assist farmers in a range of tasks from analysis and planning to actual crop planting , and subsequent field monitoring to determine health and growth . ageagle aerial systems ( company that acquired agrobotix llc ) plans to develop new products with new technologies , such as weather data , advanced image recognition and precise analysis , to give farmers / consumers better recommendations . followed by north america , high growth rates in asia pacific are expected in the coming years due to growing demand from developing nations such as india and china . in addition , increasing adoption of mechanical technology and iot gadgets in agriculture is also evaluated in order to drive the ai in the agricultural industry . in addition , europe is leading in the agricultural sector with a lucrative pace in global ai . farmers are managing nearly half of the european land area , making agriculture a dominant sector in europe . the trend in monitoring and reporting tools for indoor and outdoor farms , and providing a visualization of the entire farmer ’ s production using computer vision and artificial intelligence , is increasing the agricultural ai market . row cultivation is performed by ai in various european countries , where the robot uses 20x less herbicide due to its high accuracy in row crop weeding . artificial intelligence in agriculture market is fragmented owing to the presence of number of large-sized companies , mid-sized & small-sized companies , and many start-ups that provide artificial intelligence in agriculture industry . however , the companies that hold the majority share of artificial intelligence in agriculture market are ibm corporation , microsoft corporation , bayer ag , deere & company , a.a.a .

The artificial intelligence company that Elon Musk helped found is now selling the text-generation software it previously said was too dangerous to launch | Business Insider,"the artificial intelligence company that elon musk helped found is now selling the text-generation software it previously said was too dangerous to launch openai , the ai company and research lab that elon musk helped cofound , is commercialising a sophisticated text-generation tool it previously said was too dangerous to release widely over fears of misuse . openai , the artificial intelligence research lab that counted elon musk as its founding co-chair , is commercialising a tool it unveiled last february that can generate text after being fed just a single sentence . the tool is essentially a sophisticated text editor that can build on the words and sentences it ’ s fed to predict what comes next . when trying the tool last year , the guardian ’ s alex hern found that the system was able to match the style and language of the george orwell novel “ 1984 ” as well as an article from the guardian . that ’ s why openai is releasing the tool , the company ’ s first commercial product , as an application programming interface ( api ) in a private beta rather than open-sourcing it . reddit is among the first companies to join the private beta . the api is based on a newer and more sophisticated version of that model from last february . the company is providing access for free over the next two months while it figures out its longer-term pricing . even though openai was founded as a non-profit , the company says it decided to launch a commercial product ensure it has enough funding to succeed in its goal of making sure that “ artificial intelligence benefits everyone . ” the organisation gained much attention when it debuted in 2015 thanks to its roster of high-profile founders and backers . both musk and y combinator chairman sam altman , who is now openai ’ s ceo , were founding co-chairs of the organisation . along with musk and altman , the organisation ’ s founding donors included peter thiel , reid hoffman , and amazon web services . microsoft also invested $ us1 billion in openai last july . musk said last february that he had not been “ closely involved ” with openai for over a year , as he was focusing more closely on tesla and spacex . he also said he “ didn ’ t agree with some of what the openai team wanted to do . ”"

storysharefont sizeabcsmallabcmediumabclargesaveprintcommentsynopsismanufacturing firms are keen on using ai to automate the repair of complex machinery , thereby increasing efficacy and solving technical issues . this development was showcased in germany 's industrial home fair , where workers used ai-equipped virtual assistants to operate robots . hpe has partnered with german start-up aleph alpha to offer an ai programme that communicates with factory teams to detect machine issues or check correct installation , potentially reducing the gap caused by the 58 % shortfall of skilled labour in germany 's manufacturing sector.afpmanufacturers are hoping for the artificial intelligence revolution to reach their factories , envisaging robots being used to repair complex machinery . there has been an explosion of interest in uses of ai across many sectors since the launch last year of chatbot chatgpt from us startup openai . and at last week 's hanover fair on industrial technology in germany , the potential for artificial intelligence in the manufacturing sector was firmly in focus . via the tablet in his hands , a young employee of american it services provider hpe chatted with an ai-equipped virtual assistant , asking it to operate the arm of a robot . in order to solve a technical problem , `` factory workers no longer need to get a qualified expert on site : the artificial intelligence takes charge '' of guiding the repairs , said thomas meier , a data analyst from hpe who was presenting the prototype . the us firm , which has some 60,000 employees , has been working for the past year with aleph alpha , a german startup with some 50 staff , seen as one of openai 's leading european rivals . the innovation communicates with factory workers who can , for example , send a photo of a machine for the programme to detect any problems or check that it is correctly installed . aleph alpha 's resources are modest compared to those available to openai , which has received major financing from microsoft . but the german startup believes it has at least one major advantage -- it will keep customer data in europe . - 'increasing efficiency ' - but aleph alpha ceo jonas andrulis told afp that europe 's contribution to the ai revolution must go `` beyond regulation '' . at another stand at the hanover fair , siemens was also exhibiting an application aimed at improving factory performance . in partnership with microsoft , the german industrial conglomerate is this year planning to bring out a new version of the teams messaging platform . it will feature chatgpt and be specifically designed to help workers and spot defaults in products . microsoft and siemens , who say they are working with a number of clients in the automotive and aerospace industries , rejected accusation that ai will lead to job losses . anthony hemmelgarn , ceo of siemens digital industries software , said that 70 percent of issues were not being recorded and that ai was `` not replacing anybody '' , as certain tasks were not getting done . `` it 's all about increasing efficiency '' , he added . another advantage that ai could bring is `` alleviating the shortage of skilled workers '' , particularly in germany , said jochen koeckler , head of the hanover fair organisers . in europe 's biggest economy , almost 58 percent of manufacturers complain of workforce shortages , according to a study by the federal institute for vocational education and training published in december . for andrulis , ai will undoubtedly lead to huge upheavals in the world of work . but he also sought to offer assurances . `` it 's not like ai will take your job . but the company who will use ai will take the market share of the company who does n't . `` don ’ t miss out on et

How this secretive AI startup is helping call center employees - Business Insider,"companies are getting inundated with customer service calls as the coronavirus pandemic upends life for most americans . for help , some turn to asapp . the secretive ai startup augments the work done by call center employees through its platform that , among other things , provides automated responses and provides full customer call history . ceo gustavo sapoznik thinks it could beat industry leaders like microsoft and become the next great enterprise software company built around ai . `` a lot of those [ tech giants ] are not interested in playing in that space , even if they have those capabilities , '' he told business insider in an exclusive interview . follow all of business insider 's latest updates on the coronavirus here . click here for more bi prime stories . for help , some are turning to asapp.the secretive startup is empowering agents with tools including automated responses and a complete customer interaction history , with the goal of revolutionary , seamless interactions for employees and customers.the company says it has raised over $ 200 million in funding ( its last update in pitchbook put total funding at $ 7.57 million ) . but apart from publishing academic papers on its technology , asapp has done few outside interviews . in an exclusive interview with business insider at its headquarters in one world trade center , ceo gustavo sapoznik laid out his plans to create the next great enterprise software company built around artificial intelligence.while it 's a crowded space , he argued there 's immense opportunity that current industry behemoths like microsoft and others are ill-positioned to take advantage of , creating opportunity for an incumbent player like asapp . `` everything the research does is not product-specific , it 's task-specific , '' said sapoznik . asapp then `` cross-pollinates the efforts of our research organization across different product lines . `` while fears are rampant that automation will destroy jobs , the reality for many is that the technology remains too nascent to fully replace humans.it 's why companies like asapp have been so successful — because they aim to augment employees instead of ousting them . whether that goal changes , however , is largely dependent on just how quickly technology advances . sap helped a client secure 500 hospital beds in just 30 minutes — and it shows the power of digital transformations in helping companies respond to the coronavirus pandemic"

Can ChatGPT Predict How Stocks Will Perform? New Research Says Yes - South Florida Reporter,"chatgpt , the hugely popular artificial intelligence chatbot , can do a lot . it can write a song , give you advice or help plan a road trip . but can it predict stock price movements ? according to a new research paper , yes . alejandro lopez-lira and yuehua tang , two finance professors at the university of florida , put the chatbot to the test — and found that chatgpt can often use news headlines to determine whether a stock price will go up or down . in just a few months , chatgpt has taken the world by storm . tech giants like microsoft and google have entered the chatbot search wars , and investors are quickly seeking ways to put their money towards the future of ai . money spoke with the florida researchers about what exactly their findings mean — and how ai could change the world of finance . here ’ s how the experiment worked . lopez-lira and tang asked chatgpt to determine if about 40,000 headlines — published between october 2021 and december 2022 about stocks listed on the new york stock exchange , nasdaq and american stock exchange — were positive or negative for the stock . the researchers predict that if investing firms were not already using this technology , they ’ ll start now — and that the markets will become more efficient because of it , meaning stock prices will better reflect all the most up-to-date information . ( a more efficient market is harder for investors to beat . ) “ if , before , the headline took one day to fully absorb in the market , perhaps now it will take like one minute , ” lopez-lira tells money . “ as investors start incorporating these language models into their framework , they can trade much faster , and the prices should adapt quickly . ” keep in mind that it ’ s typically institutional investors who have the infrastructure to actually do this . and of course , if everyone started using chatgpt in this way to help make investing decisions , doing so would no longer give you an edge , he adds . ( though there may be more room for large language models like chatgpt to predict movements of small stocks and international stocks since many institutional investors are paying closer attention to larger u.s. stocks and therefore making those markets more efficient . )"
UltraSight Receives CE Mark for Novel Cardiac AI Technology,"at 8:30 am edt|updated : 36 minutes agolandmark achievement paves the way for increased patient access to cardiac imaging and optimized care across europe in 2023barcelona , spain , /prnewswire/ -- ultrasight , an israeli-based digital health pioneer transforming cardiac imaging through the power of artificial intelligence , announced it has obtained a ce mark for its ai guidance software for cardiac ultrasound . today 's milestone comes just ahead of the european society of cardiology ( esc ) congress in barcelona and aligns with its call for action to achieve heart health in europe by 2025.ultrasight ( prnewswire ) ultrasight 's technology allows medical professionals , regardless of their sonography experience , to successfully capture diagnostic quality ultrasound images of the heart . the technology can be used at the point of care , paving the way for more widespread detection of cardiovascular diseases ( cvd ) and improved access to optimized cardiac care across the continent.the novel ai software pairs with point of care ultrasound devices that are currently on the market and provides the operator with real-time instructions on how to capture high quality diagnostic images . the underlying ai neural network predicts the position of the ultrasound probe relative to the heart , based on the ultrasound video stream only , and guides the user on how to maneuver the probe to ensure that the acquired images are of diagnostic quality . `` ultrasight was founded with the intention to apply the power of machine learning in imaging and put the ability to scan patients into the hands of physicians everywhere , '' said davidi vortman , ceo of ultrasight . `` by empowering more medical professionals to accurately scan patients , we will have faster and greater detection of cvd across the continent . this is not only a momentous occasion for ultrasight as a company , but it brings us one step closer to helping the millions of people in europe who suffer from cvd . `` according to the esc1 , there are 113 million people living with cvd in europe today . europe has the highest cvd mortality rate in the world , with approximately four million people succumbing to this disease each year . cvd is the leading cause of death for europeans.ultrasight obtained ce mark after results from a clinical study held at the sheba medical center , israel , validated its technology and confirmed that the software is effective at instructing novice medical professionals to acquire diagnostic-quality cardiac images . the study found that ultrasight ai guidance allowed medical professionals who did not have prior sonography experience to obtain diagnostic quality cardiac images in 100 percent of patients . the study was conducted using the philips lumify ultrasound device . `` many medical residents have entered the healthcare field since the pandemic ; however , being able to provide them with the necessary hands-on training and supervision has become challenging for many european emergency departments looking to adopt point of care ultrasound , '' said prof. salvatore di somma , md , phd , director of emergency medicine and chairman of the postgraduate school of emergency medicine at the department of medical-surgery sciences and translational medicine university of sapienza in rome , italy . `` supporting new ultrasound users with ai guidance , such as ultrasight 's ai guidance software , would increase efficiencies and expedite the learning curve while also reducing the time for obtaining good echocardiographic imaging in the emergency room , opening resources for experienced staff to respond to other acute needs . `` `` point of care ultrasound can be a very useful tool for intensive care unit physicians . some key hemodynamic measurements , such as left ventricular outflow tract velocity time integral ( lvot vti ) , provide invaluable help to guide fluid therapy . however , some physicians are still reluctant to use it because they consider this measurement a competence reserved for advanced ultrasound operators , '' said professor bernard cholley , icu department head at the hôpital européen georges pompidou , paris , france . `` when introduced to ultrasight 's ai guidance software , we were very compelled by the prospect of ai supporting more healthcare providers , including novice ultrasound users , to acquire a cardiac ultrasound view by which the lvot vti can be measured accurately for a reliable measurement and optimized patient care . `` the ultrasight ai guidance software is indicated for use in two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography ( 2d-tte ) for adult patients . it is intended to assist medical professionals in performing cardiac ultrasound scans . ultrasight ai guidance software is an accessory to compatible general-purpose diagnostic ultrasound systems and is intended to be used by medical professionals who have received ultrasight 's training as described in the user manual.the ultrasight software is expected to become available in europe in 2023 ."
No Job Is Future-Proof. How To Adopt AI While Protecting Your Employees,"let ’ s get this straight : artificial intelligence is automating away roles across industries . it doesn ’ t matter how much creativity or critical thinking a task might need . no job is future-proof . what ’ s the real human cost of ushering in this fantastic , ai-driven future ? can leaders realistically take care of their employees while tapping into the efficiencies of automation ? while best buy offered competitive pricing and used ml algorithms to improve its operational efficiencies , the cornerstone of its turnaround strategy was humans . this is an excellent reminder that organizations can not only embrace ai but can also leverage their team ’ s deeply human skills to re-energize their business . organizations competing in the age of ai face a lot of pressures . they wrestle with competitors over a piece of the shifting market pie , they innovate to serve fickle customer expectations , and they juggle investor demands for growing returns on capital . executives , in turn , are looking for ways that data and ai can help manage these forces . it begs the question : how can companies innovate with ai while also taking care of critical internal stakeholders — their employees ? evaluate how ai can augment your business and improve your operating model . you must explore ways that technology can help your people perform their jobs better . “ in less than ten years , every takeda employee will be empowered by an ai assistant , ” says christophe weber , the president and ceo of takeda . he believes augmented intelligence will help his team make better decisions and deliver a transformative experience to patients , physicians , and payers . remember , it may not always be possible to retain humans in a workflow when it ’ s automated . however , ai often opens opportunities for innovative business offerings and new roles that can improve your competitive advantage , as in best buy ’ s adviser program . “ more than 60 % of jobs performed in 2018 had not yet been invented in 1940 , ” according to an mit report . so , invest in up-skilling and out-skilling your workforce proactively to prepare them for adjacent or new roles . on a similar note , it ’ s not only possible but critical to take care of your employees as you adopt ai . for example , american wholesale retailer boxed used robots to automate 75 % of jobs at its warehouse in union , new jersey . however , not one employee was fired . instead , the team is being retrained to manage the bots , maintain the software , or handle customer service . “ if you 're in the boardroom talking about automation , you also need to talk about the human impact and put your employees on top of the list , '' says chieh huang , ceo of boxed . “ to prepare your organization for the future , you must go back in time to study the previous waves of automation , ” recommends roose . “ technology-driven change is not new , and we aren ’ t starting from scratch today . ” as organizations embrace technology innovation to meet rising business demands , leaders must make responsible decisions by factoring in the interest of all stakeholders , including their employees . leaders must speak openly with employees about what ai means for their jobs and how technology can augment their roles . when automation makes roles redundant , leaders must communicate transparently , plan ahead for redeployment , and share how the organization can help employees with the transition . the key to making the switch into an ai-driven business is by earning your employees ’ trust ."

let ’ s see if we get harassed , ” she says , striding off to walk its perimeter . it ’ s only when we turn on to the street behind the building that it becomes clear how massive it is : looming above us is a shimmering , curved facade , perhaps 10 storeys high and stretching a city block into the distance like a beached ocean liner . “ look at that facility , that is vast , ” crawford says.but the size of the structure is not the only indication of scale . crawford points out white , orange and pink fluorescent hieroglyphics on the footpath : numbers and letters , lines and symbols , a secret language of the street identifying what lies beneath : gas and water pipes , power and telecommunications lines , fibre-optic cables . “ this is huge amounts of data capacity , the kind of grunt for data storage and processing. ” i ’ ve driven past this building on harris street , ultimo , countless times and never noticed it ; now , at the start of a walking tour with crawford designed to get a sense of how artificial intelligence is woven into the texture of our lives and cities , “ to make the invisible visible ” , i think it seems almost artfully anonymous , as though designed to be incognito . but it ’ s the sort of building crawford wants people to notice and know about : this building , touted as australia ’ s “ only hyper-scale data centre campus ” , is one of many similar centres around the world and stores a cargo of digital infrastructure and data. “ the creation of contemporary ai systems depends on exploiting energy and mineral resources from the planet , cheap labour , and data at scale. ” “ data centres are basically the backbone of how ai and large-scale data processing work , ” she says . we think of artificial intelligence as something floating above us , disembodied , suspended and without earthly costs or consequences ; it is frequently represented in imagery as blue tunnels of suspended numbers , illuminated circuit boards or white robots , the stuff of science fiction . but crawford believes that such imaginaries misdirect people from what is unfolding in the real world , the material world . ai is anything but immaterial ; for its very existence , it relies on an earthly and unsustainable supply chain.advertisement “ the creation of contemporary ai systems depends on exploiting energy and mineral resources from the planet , cheap labour , and data at scale , ” crawford says . alongside climate change , she believes ai is the most profound story of our time : omnipresent and pervasive and weighted with potential for exploitation and bias . it is one of the planet ’ s biggest political , cultural and social shifts for centuries . and , she thinks , “ a lot of people are sleepwalking into it ” .if i were to write kate crawford into a science-fiction script , she would be a heroic , flame-haired seer carrying warnings of looming demonic forces to a fragile and uncertain civilisation . in real life , the characterisation is not altogether imprecise.canberra-raised crawford , 44 , has lived in manhattan since 2014 but until early july was in sydney with her american partner , jason schultz , a law professor , and their eight-year-old son , elliott , spending time with family . but it has hardly been a holiday ; her zoom account and signal encrypted communication app have been busy . the futurist ’ s pioneering work over two decades exploring ai ’ s implications means she is feted as an international speaker . she has advised policy-makers in the white house and the united nations , and addressed french president emmanuel macron at an intimate policy dinner at the élysée palace in paris.loadingher digital project , anatomy of an ai system , a collaboration with the serbian academic and artist vladan joler which looks at amazon ’ s echo smart speaker as “ an artificial intelligence system made of human labour ” , is held in the permanent collections of new york ’ s museum of modern art and london ’ s victoria & albert museum . she has affiliations with universities and labs around the world , including the university of southern california , microsoft research , école normale supérieure in paris and the university of sydney. “ what kate does so well is she crystallises , in a practical way , what some of the risks and threats are , ” says australian human rights commissioner edward santow . “ there are plenty of uses of ai that are innocuous , but she shines a very clear light on how ai can cause harm. ” advertisementvia zoom , i speak to two of crawford ’ s friends in new york . laura poitras , the director of citizenfour , the oscar-winning edward snowden documentary , first met crawford at a conference in beijing . “ she was just one of the most interesting people i ’ ve ever been in dialogue with , in terms of the breadth of her knowledge and curiosity and her analysis of power , ” poitras says.artist trevor paglen tells me that crawford has never been interested in “ hermetic ” academic texts or writing . to illuminate issues related to ai , the pair have created projects at the intersection of art and academia , including training humans , an exhibition of imagery used to train artificial intelligence systems , held at milan ’ s contemporary art museum fondazione prada in 2019. the pair frequently have long talks late into the night at a bar near their manhattan homes , discussing ideas and seemingly obscure subjects such as “ the politics of classification and 17th-century attempts to develop universal languages ” . paglen says they ’ re both committed to articulating complex ideas “ in ways that don ’ t require a phd in a specialised field ” .there has never been a more important time for such articulation . in multiple , cascading and interconnected ways , ai is determining the nature of our world ; it influences global security and power , the relationships between nation states , the fairness of societies and , as the algorithms targeting voters on facebook during the 2016 us presidential election illustrated , the functioning of our democracies . ai is increasingly involved in our most banal daily activities , from popping into a shop for a bottle of milk and getting a loan , to working from home during a lockdown.as ai ’ s application in almost all areas of human life has surged , so , too , have responses from governments and academia : in june , the federal government unveiled a plan to establish australia as a world leader in artificial intelligence and use “ cutting-edge ai technologies to solve australia ’ s national challenges ” . a search for “ artificial intelligence ” on twitter gives a sense of the onslaught : dozens of ai-related tweets spit out every minute . a recent sample : “ is this how the world ends ? artificial intelligence and american security ” ; “ artificial intelligence is the next step in evolution ” , “ pornhub uses artificial intelligence to restore century-old erotic films ” ; “ nsw police using artificial intelligence to analyse cctv footage ” ; “ china tests ai emotion-detection software on uighurs ” ; “ the future of elder care is here – and it ’ s artificial intelligence ” ; “ artificial intelligence enables new colonoscopy screening method ” …santow believes we are at a crossroads . “ we ’ re at the end of what i ’ m starting to call ‘ first generation ai ’ because it certainly is an improvement in many areas on what came before it ; it allows us to use information more effectively , but it ’ s really prone to error. ” not surprisingly , it ’ s a subject increasingly occupying the minds of watchdog organisations . in late april , the european union announced a proposal for the first-ever legal framework covering ai . it proposes banning any systems considered “ a clear threat to the safety , livelihoods and rights of people ” , including anything that “ manipulate [ s ] human behaviour to circumvent users ’ free will ... and systems that allow ‘ social scoring ’ by governments ” . a month later , the australian human rights commission ’ s human rights and technology final report was released . it includes 38 recommendations to ensure new technologies , particularly ai , are developed and used in ways that are “ inclusive , accountable and with robust human rights safeguards ” .in his foreword to the report , edward santow acknowledges that ai is enabling advances in areas such as healthcare and service delivery . but he also issues a warning : “ the use of ai can ... open the door to a range of dystopian threats – from mass surveillance to unaccountable exercise of power by government and corporations. ” advertisementcrawford and artist trevor paglen at milan ’ s fondazione prada , which hosted their training humans exhibition in 2019. credit : marco cappelletti/courtesy fondazione pradaas i follow kate crawford away from the massive ultimo data centre towards the sydney cbd , she stops to look back . “ that building is a beautiful way to illustrate the story , ” she says , reminding me of its spy-thriller-worthy background.loadingthe 73,000-square-metre data centre is owned by global switch , which has multi-customer data centres around the world . for some years , its ultimo facility ’ s tenants have included sensitive government agencies including the department of defence , but when a chinese consortium bought half of global switch ’ s parent company in 2016 , the government got nervous and started the process of migrating data , including highly classified military and intelligence files , out of the facility . earlier this year , reports emerged that defence had been forced to delay its full departure from the centre and sign a new $ 53.5 million contract to run until 2025 . ( the chinese steel giant , the jiangsu shagang group , is now the majority shareholder of global switch . ) for crawford , the global switch story illuminates much about ai and big data systems . “ there is growing geopolitical anxiety and we see this particularly in the so-called ‘ ai war ’ between the us and china , in which there is a paranoid vision of defending a national cloud against a racialised enemy. ” in june last year , the wall street journal reported that china had “ embarked on a new trillion-dollar campaign to develop next-generation technologies as it seeks to catapult the communist nation ahead of the us in critical areas ” . soon after taking office in january , the biden administration issued executive orders to address supply-chain vulnerabilities that have led to shortages in crucial products such as computer chips , and to counter china ’ s dominance in the production of minerals that are core components of phones , computers and rechargeable batteries.beyond the geopolitical storyline that the global switch facility offers , it is , crawford says , a reminder of the materiality of data and ai . “ it was such a tell that it was a complex data problem for the australian defence force ; it ’ s not as easy as pressing a button ; again , it ’ s not immaterial . it ’ s a big infrastructure move that takes years. ” advertisementas we walk past the chinese garden of friendship , with a soundscape of children laughing in the darling harbour playground , crawford talks about the “ myth of clean tech ” : how ai and forms of data processing gobble energy and are a major driver of climate change , she says.the process to build an ai “ model ” – a program or algorithm “ trained ” to recognise patterns or features in data to make systems such as apple ’ s siri or amazon ’ s alexa , or to augment human decision-making , or to teach a self-driving car to identify objects in its path – consumes enormous amounts of energy . data centre networks carrying the large-scale computation required for ai model-making and cloud computing platforms such as the massive amazon web services are among the world ’ s largest consumers of electricity.in her compelling new book , atlas of ai : power , politics and the planetary costs of artificial intelligence , crawford observes that the carbon footprint of the world ’ s computational infrastructure has matched that of the aviation industry at its height . but the exact volume of energy consumed by the tech sector ’ s production of ai models is unknown . “ that information is kept as highly guarded corporate secrets ... the data economy is premised on maintaining environmental ignorance , ” she says.and in the face of the imperative to reduce carbon emissions , the trend in ai is towards faster processing speeds and super computers , which consume even greater volumes of energy . but the environmental costs of ai are not confined to energy consumption . crawford writes of the unsustainable mining of natural resources such as lithium , of “ acid-bleached rivers and deracinated landscapes and the extinction of plant and animal species that were once vital to the local ecology ” ; of the massive volumes of water used to cool data-centre servers ; and of toxic e-waste dumping grounds in countries such as ghana and pakistan.to research her final chapter for atlas of ai , crawford drove into the west texas desert to glimpse the rocket base for blue origin , amazon founder jeff bezos ’ s private aerospace company . fearing that earth ’ s soaring energy needs will soon outstrip supply , the world ’ s richest man has a vision of a future in which millions of people live and work in space . crawford shares with me some of her thinking behind her interrogation of the aspirations of bezos and tesla and spacex ’ s proprietor elon musk . “ these are the billionaires who made their fortunes from ai and they ’ re spending all that money trying to leave the planet . it ’ s not , ‘ how do we address the problem ? ‘ , it ’ s ‘ how the hell do we get out of here ? ’ ” crawford ( at left ) in the early 2000s with nicole skeltys : their electronic dance music duo b [ if ] tek explored “ the human/machine divide ” .credit : advertisementwe ’ re heading to a city 7-eleven , but outside an internet cafe on the fringes of chinatown , crawford stops and looks up . “ that ’ s it , ” she exclaims , pointing up at a series of arched windows on a vintage building . it ’ s the new york-loft-style space where she lived in the early 2000s while lecturing in media and communications at the university of sydney and writing her phd on adulthood and technology.at the same time , crawford was writing music as one half ( with nicole skeltys ) of the avant-garde electronic dance music duo b ( if ) tek . now , looking back at old b ( if ) tek videos and their sci-fi visual tropes , it ’ s as though there ’ s a direct line between the irony-rich compositions and crawford ’ s contemporary work on ai . “ we ’ re interested in ‘ the human/machine divide ’ , ” crawford told the sydney morning herald in 2003. b ( if ) tek ’ s track machines work uses a sample from a 1967 ibm word processor ad : “ machines can do the work , so that people have time to think. ” a single , we think you ’ re dishy , includes the lines , “ we are the b ( if ) tek corporation/we have been watching you. ” someone will be watching you if you grab a slurpee at a 7-eleven . outside the outlet , we read a notice on the window : “ by entering the store you consent to facial recognition cameras capturing and storing your image. ” inside , we study an array of cctv cameras on the ceiling before engaging with a tablet device on the counter . “ how did we do today ? ” is the question on the screen above four faces emoting levels of satisfaction , from the green-smiley “ awesome ” to the red-angry “ awful ” . subsequent questions probe the main reason for my visit and whether staff have asked if i have the “ my 7-eleven ” app . it ’ s only as i tap in my final responses to the survey that i notice the screen ’ s small black camera “ eye ” . “ how would you know how this data is being processed ; it could be connected to facial recognition or emotion detection technology , ” says crawford as we leave the shop and its prying eyes . for some years she ’ s been arguing for a moratorium on the use of facial recognition technology . later , i email questions to 7-eleven . the reply is swift : a spokesperson says the chain uses the tablet-based system to solicit customer feedback and when someone chooses to do the survey , the tablet captures their image to filter out “ potential duplicates ” . he says cctv cameras are for security purposes only and do not operate with facial recognition or other biometric technology . both the cctv footage and images captured when customers complete the tablet survey are deleted within weeks . nevertheless , the office of the australian information commissioner confirmed to me that it is investigating 7-eleven ’ s use of facial recognition technology.biometric technology , which uses one or more of a person ’ s physical or biological characteristics for the purposes of identification , has been around since before arthur conan doyle gave sherlock holmes a magnifying glass and pointed him in the direction of some fingerprints . but as the australian human rights commission ’ s report notes , it has been “ supercharged by ai ” and its new capabilities to analyse large sources of data.facial recognition technology , a subset of biometrics , maps the geometry of a face , the length of a nose , the curve of a mouth , the distance between brow and eyelid . it then uses ai to compare the face to either another image of the same person ( one-to-one facial verification such as that used at australian airport passport control , smartgates ) or a larger “ one-to-many ” database of images , such as that which might be held by a police department . or that used by chinese authorities to identify people for investigation and/or detention in the uighur autonomous region of xinjiang . or a database such as the one containing more than three billion faces owned by a shady new york-based facial recognition software company with connections to the far right , clearview ai.loading “ i would imagine all of us , you , me , anyone who ’ s ever had a picture on the internet , is probably in the clearview ai system , ” crawford says as we walk towards the towers of barangaroo , where facebook has its australian headquarters . the story of clearview ai and its three billion faces offers an insight into the multi-faceted issues connected to ai and personal data : how data is extracted , how it is classified , how it is used and its potentials for harm.last year , the new york times published an article about clearview , headlined , “ the secretive company that might end privacy as we know it. ” it revealed that clearview ’ s database of faces had been “ scraped ” from public sites including employment and news sites , and social networks such as facebook , and includes links to the images ’ online sources . clearview told the nyt that more than 600 law-enforcement agencies were using its technology to assist in investigating crimes including shoplifting , identity theft and child sex-abuse . a month later , buzzfeed reported that clearview was working with more than 2000 agencies around the world and that four australian police forces ( the australian federal police and the queensland , victorian and south australian forces ) had tested its technology.concerns about clearview ai are legion , including its secrecy , the almost inconceivable invasion of privacy its scraping practices constitute , the chance for errors in matches , and in the genie-out-of-a-bottle dystopia its technology has the potential to launch . the nyt article noted that computer code underlying the clearview app includes programming language to pair it with augmented-reality glasses . “ users would potentially be able to identify every person they saw . the tool could identify activists at a protest or an attractive stranger on the subway , revealing not just their names but where they lived , what they did and whom they knew , ” the article said . “ searching someone by face could become as easy as googling a name . strangers would be able to listen in on sensitive conversations , take photos of the participants and know personal secrets ... it would herald the end of public anonymity. ” ( clearview told the nyt that it had designed a prototype for use with augmented-reality glasses but had no plans to release it . ) the backlash against clearview , and to facial recognition technology more broadly , has been considerable . the office of the australian information commissioner and the uk information commissioner ’ s office are jointly investigating clearview . in february , the canadian privacy commissioner announced clearview was no longer welcome in canada and should delete canadian faces from its database . “ it is completely unacceptable for millions of people who will never be implicated in any crime to find themselves continually in a police line-up , ” the privacy commissioner daniel therrien said . in may , a number of european privacy organisations announced they had filed legal complaints against clearview.but corporations are not the only organisations to fear : if george orwell taught us anything , it ’ s that we also need to keep a close watch on our governments . the federal government ’ s attempts to create a national facial recognition database that would enable “ one-to-many ” identification were temporarily stymied in 2019 when the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security rejected the proposed legislation , arguing it had insufficient safeguards to protect people ’ s privacy and rights . redrafted laws will inevitably resurface at some point . they are likely to ignore one of the key recommendations in the australian human rights commission ’ s report : that all governments should introduce a moratorium on the use of facial recognition and other biometric technology “ in decision-making that has a legal , or similarly significant , effect for individuals , or where there is a high risk to human rights , such as in policing and law enforcement ” .facial recognition algorithms get things wrong . video surveillance cameras clocked the faces of thousands of people during london metropolitan police service trials of facial recognition technology which started in 2016. of the “ suspects ” identified in the trials , more than 80 per cent were incorrect matches ; they were in fact innocent passers-by . and here ’ s another one : the story of robert williams , a detroit black man accused of stealing watches from a luxury store and arrested in his driveway last year while his wife and kids watched . “ this is not me , ” williams said when , during questioning , police showed him a grainy photograph of the suspect . the photo had been run through the detroit police department ’ s facial recognition system and incorrectly matched with an old drivers ’ licence photo of williams . according to the mit technology review , the department ’ s ai system was responsible for two other false arrests . they were both black men , too. “ people of colour , women , people with physical disability are all far less likely to be accurately identified using facial recognition than basically people who look like me : white , middle-aged men. ” “ what we know is that errors are not evenly distributed across the community , ” says australian human rights commissioner edward santow . “ people of colour , women , people with physical disability are all far less likely to be accurately identified using facial recognition than basically people who look like me : white , middle-aged men. ” but issues of bias in ai go far beyond the potential for facial recognition errors . bias and discrimination can be embedded in the very “ brains ” of ai systems . to understand how this happens , it helps to understand the process through which artificial intelligence becomes “ intelligent ” . our publicly available digital personal data is the fuel that powers ai , and when our faces are “ harvested ” , they might not just be used for the purposes of facial recognition/identification . they can be classified and included in vast “ training datasets ” which are used to build algorithms for ai functions including object detection and language prediction.consider , for example , the task of building an ai system to detect the difference between an apple and an orange : as crawford explains in atlas of ai , a developer must first collect , label and train a neural network using thousands of labelled images of apples and oranges . algorithms then conduct a statistical survey of the images and develop a model to recognise the difference between the two fruits.to mount the training humans exhibition in milan , crawford and trevor paglen spent two years poring over training sets , including the ground-breaking imagenet , which was created in the mid-2000s to map the entire world of objects and is led by researchers from a number of american universities . the pair were shocked by what they found in the images ’ labels . sure , some made sense : cat , dog , apple , tree . but then they looked at how people were categorised . “ you look at ‘ ceo ’ and ‘ oh , it ’ s mostly white men , that ’ s interesting , ’ then you look at ‘ basketballer ’ and it ’ s mostly black men . then the categories start to shift and become moral judgments . so you have ‘ bad person ’ , you have ‘ kleptomaniac ’ ... the most appalling racist and misogynistic epithets. ” crawford recalls seeing a young woman ’ s graduation photo . “ she had a low-cut dress on and now she ’ s in the ‘ slattern ’ training category. ” the labels had been imported from a database of words , wordnet and , through the crowdsourcing labour platform amazon mechanical turk , given to a global army of “ digital pieceworkers ” , each of whom was paid a few cents an hour to label 60 or more images a minute . “ it ’ s this idea that you can create ground truth from scraped flotsam and jetsam off the internet , ” crawford says.atlas of ai notes multiple other examples of embedded discrimination , including gender bias in apple ’ s creditworthiness algorithms , chatbots that adopt racist and misogynistic language , voice-recognition software failing to recognise female-sounding voices , and social media platforms showing more highly-paid job advertisements to men than to women.in june , the new york times published a story about the increasing number of start-ups offering systems to identify and remove bias from ai systems . in an echo of the robodebt debacle in australia , the article noted the us federal trade commission ’ s recent warning to companies about the sale of racially biased ai systems or those which could prevent individuals from receiving employment , housing , insurance or other benefits . the article also shared an example : in 2018 , an american ai start-up aiming to build a system to remove nude or explicit images from the internet sent millions of photos to workers in india who were to tag explicit material . when the work was finished , the start-up discovered a problem : the workers had tagged every image of a same-sex couple as “ indecent ” .highlighting the processes in how some ai is created , the training humans exhibition displayed imagery – as crawford puts it , “ scraped flotsam and jetsam off the internet ” – used to “ train ” ai systems.credit : marco cappelletti/courtesy fondazione pradacrawford and i have roamed barangaroo ’ s shadowy lanes , passed through multiple revolving doors into gleaming office tower lobbies , studied tenants ’ directories , followed security officers ’ directions into other lobbies , and still have not seen even a hint of facebook ’ s headquarters . “ it ’ s like an escher experience of public space , like , ‘ you ’ re not welcome , we do not want people coming to engage with us ’ , ” crawford says of our fruitless in-and-out , up-and-down search. “ it ’ s not public infrastructure , it ’ s for profit ; they have no obligation to make sure information is accessible , even in a health crisis. ” how clever facebook has been : it has persuaded us to think it ’ s for us , for everybody , for soccer mums and community groups and reconnecting with old friends . instead , as crawford explains , the trillions of photos , voice clips and bites of text that make up our facebook content ( and our content on instagram , which was bought by facebook in 2012 ) is training one of the largest ai systems in the world which , in turn , is creating an “ unbelievably powerful ” facial recognition engine . “ it ’ s not public infrastructure , it ’ s for profit ; they have no obligation to make sure information is accessible , even in a health crisis. ” crawford was appalled when , in february , facebook blacked out australian mainstream media organisations ’ newsfeed posts over a new law requiring tech giants to pay for content . “ it was shocking . that was one of the most stark experiences of platform power , the power to say , ‘ we don ’ t like the way this negotiation is going , we ’ ll switch off the pipes thank you very much. ’ and that , to me , is the most telling experience of how hard it ’ s going to be to regulate big tech. ” loadingthe episode supports one of crawford ’ s greatest fears about ai : that it gives more power to a highly concentrated sector of already powerful tech companies . “ historically , i don ’ t think there ’ s a comparison in the widening asymmetries of power. ” but in countless ways , the ai power imbalance will also increasingly be felt at a micro level in our everyday lives , especially in the relationship between bosses and workers.for generations we ’ ve worried that robots are coming to take our jobs but , as crawford notes , the greater threat might be that humans will increasingly be treated like robots . as we ’ ve walked through the city , we ’ ve noticed innumerable “ for lease ” signs on office buildings , a reminder that , around the world , the pandemic has created armies of remote workers.get ready for an era of invasive algorithmic management in which your boss watches you remotely ( in “ stealth mode ” , if they choose ) : how long you are online , what tabs you have open on your screen , how efficient you are.if your kid works in a fast-food outlet or a shop , ai management systems will monitor performance indicators such as how fast they make a cheeseburger , or whether they push-sell to customers ( no , the 7-eleven staffer didn ’ t ask me if i have the “ my 7-eleven ” app – will he be in trouble ? ) . if you work in a warehouse or a factory , such as an amazon “ fulfilment centre ” , surveillance systems will record your “ picking rate ” : the rate at which you gather products to meet orders . for atlas of ai , crawford visited a mammoth amazon fulfilment centre in new jersey . she observed multiple workers with knee braces , elbow bandages or wrist guards . at intervals through the factory , she says , vending machines are “ stocked with over-the-counter painkillers for anyone who needs them ” .loadingin a letter to amazon shareholders in april , jeff bezos noted that , to decrease work-related musculoskeletal disorders , the company was automating staff schedules using “ sophisticated algorithms ” to shuffle staff between jobs using different muscle-tendon groups . “ they ’ re resisting unionisation every step of the way and using rampant surveillance technology to try to produce the most efficient mechanism to extract value from human bodies down to the level of muscles and ligaments , ” says crawford . by the end of this year , australia will have six amazon fulfilment centres , including a new “ robotics fulfilment centre ” the size of 24 rugby league fields in western sydney.in her book ’ s final , chilling chapter , crawford stops beside a road in west texas and looks across a valley towards jeff bezos ’ s blue origin rocket launch facility . she describes it as “ a techno-scientific imaginary of power , extraction , and escape … a hedge against earth ” . as she pulls her car back out onto the road , she realises

Nickel oxide is a material that can 'learn' like animals and could help further artificial intelligence research,"a unique material , nickel oxide demonstrates the ability to learn things about its environment in a way that emulates the most basic learning abilities of animals , as my colleagues and i describe in a new paper . nickel oxide has features that are strikingly similar to this learning behavior . instead of gills retracting , we measured the change in electrical conductivity of the material . the stimulus , instead of a finger poke , was repeatedly alternating the environment of the nickel oxide between normal air and hydrogen gas . nickel oxide is interesting because when you expose it to hydrogen gas , its crystalline structure subtly changes and more electrons become available to generate an electrical current . in our experiment , we kept switching between the hydrogen-only and regular air environments . you would expect the electrical conductivity to oscillate up and down directly in relation to the exposure to hydrogen or air . but just as with the sea slugs , the change in conductivity of the nickel oxide slowly went down the more we stimulated it . it got habituated to the hydrogen . the ability to learn , remember or forget information as needed is a powerful skill for any animal or machine . so far , the vast majority of research in the field of artificial intelligence has focused on software-based approaches to machine learning , with far less effort dedicated to studying the learning abilities of materials . at the center of these two related areas of research lies the field of brain-inspired computers . for intelligence to be encoded into hardware , scientists need semiconductors that can learn from past experience and adapt to dynamic environments in a physical way similar to that of neurons in animal brains . our new research showing how nickel oxide demonstrates features of learning hints at how this or similar materials could serve as building blocks for computers of the future . before such materials can be incorporated into computer chips there are some knowledge gaps that need to be addressed . for instance , it is not yet clear at what time scales a material needs to learn for it to be useful in electrical systems . how quickly does something need to learn or forget to be useful ? another unknown is how or whether it is possible to change the structure of nickel oxide to produce different learning behaviors . in addition to further experiments on the material itself , there are theoretical lessons to explore . observations of collective behavior of animals in nature – such as bird flocks and schools of fish – have inspired researchers to develop fields of ai like swarm intelligence . in a similar fashion , the interesting collective motion of atoms and electrons in materials could inspire ai and hardware design in the future . as new materials that can accommodate mobile atoms are discovered , i am optimistic we will see further breakthroughs that can bring researchers one step closer to designing computers that emulate animal brains . this article is republished from the conversation under a creative commons license . read the original article here : https : //theconversation.com/nickel-oxide-is-a-material-that-can-learn-like-animals-and-could-help-further-artificial-intelligence-research-173048 ."
"Privacy bill would set out rules on use of personal data, artificial intelligence – Trail Daily Times","the federal liberals plan to introduce privacy legislation today to give canadians more control over their personal data and introduce new rules for the use of artificial intelligence . the bill , to be presented by innovation minister françois-philippe champagne , aims to fulfil his mandate to advance the federal digital charter , strengthen privacy protections for consumers and provide clear rules for fair competition in the online marketplace . that bill would have required companies to obtain consent from customers through plain language , not a long legal document , before using their personal data . the bill would have armed the federal privacy commissioner with order-making powers , including the ability to demand that a company stop collecting data or using personal information , and to recommend that a planned tribunal impose a fine . it would give consumers less control and organizations more flexibility in monetizing personal data without increasing their accountability , he said in may of last year , before the legislation expired upon the general election call . therrien , whose term as commissioner recently ended , also said the legislation put commercial interests ahead of the privacy rights of people , and he advocated adopting a framework that would entrench privacy as a human right . philippe dufresne , the government ’ s nominee to replace therrien , told a house of commons committee this week the coming bill must recognize privacy as a “ fundamental right . ” update : west trail infrastructure job rescheduled for thursday how much money will entice elvis back into the building ? butterfly beauty is brief montrose plants roots for community diversity and inclusion"

Ghost in the drum machine: How creative AI is kicking off a paradigm shift in music | MusicTech,"4newsgearmusiclearnfreewarepodcasts4dealsfeaturesghost in the drum machine : how creative ai is kicking off a paradigm shift in musicmeet the artists and developers leading the next evolution of songwriting . by clovis mcevoy # ai # artist/producer/djby clovis mcevoynothing captures the popular imagination quite like artificial intelligence . as far back as the 19th century , soothsayers have been promising and warning against it in equal measure . while we have yet to achieve a post-scarcity utopia or descend into a robot-ruled wasteland , year upon year , little by little , many of those predictions have jumped from the pages of sci-fi novels and into news headlines . as ever-increasing computing power turns future fantasies into tangible reality.read more : anna lunoe : “ when i ’ m structuring a track , i get a cup of tea , put it on , and dance ” from law enforcement to medicine and visual arts to weaponry , the real-world impacts of ai are already being felt . it ’ s the same with music . tech ’ s best and brightest are hard at work trying to streamline the songwriting process or replace it altogether : splice ’ s similar sounds uses ai to scan thousands of samples before offering the best kick to complement your snare ; orb ’ s producer suite generates rhythms , melodies and chord progressions to help you get started on a track ; and services like amper need only a few keywords to create fully realised background music.so , are composers and songwriters staring into the void of their own obsolescence ? there ’ s certainly some justified anxiety about what these tools will mean for the industry at large , however , for many artists , ai is not a threat but an opportunity – a new instrument that could usher in a musical renaissance comparable to the advent of 1980s sampling culture.splice ’ s similar sounds . image : splicehere we ’ re talking to some of the artists and developers who are harnessing the creative potential of ai to make new sounds , new musical forms , and new ways of working.of course , ai music is not a monolith . various approaches are being taken to reach a diverse set of goals , but one thing many of the most innovative projects have in common is their use of artificial neural networks – computer systems whose architecture is inspired by the human brain . these in turn power deep learning algorithms which pass an input , in this case audio , through sequential network layers , progressively extracting more information with each step.if all that sounds both very nerdy and decidedly un-rock ’ n ’ roll , let me introduce you to dadabots . since 2017 , duo zack zukowski and cj carr have been training neural networks on a heady mix of math rock , black metal , and punk in order to generate inhuman riffs , screams that no lungs could muster , and endless rhythmic complexity . dadabots ’ approach to ai music is both labour intensive and creatively demanding : speaking of their recent entry to the annual ai song contest , the pair told us that they “ treated the ai models like they were session musicians , directed by our imagination ” . each musical idea required selecting , training and ‘ tuning ’ a neural network to consistently generate musical textures in a fitting style . even then , the duo needed to “ dig through hundreds of variations to find the ones that fit best ” before arranging the parts in a traditional daw.the resulting track , nuns in a moshpit , is a tour de force of ai production techniques . “ we used eight different families of neural nets , some of which is our new research from the past year , ” say the duo . “ valuable phd and r & d hours were spent building totally new concepts for ai models , just to generate single 5 second riffs in this song that only appear once. ” then there are artists like robin sloan and jesse solomon clark , whose musical project , the cotton modules , blends bleeding-edge tech with decidedly lo-fi working habits to achieve their ambient and eerily evocative debut album , shadow planet . using openai ’ s jukebox , which draws from a repertoire of more than a million songs to generate music and vocals , the pair began trading song ideas back and forth via cassette tape during the pandemic. “ i started by creating short musical ‘ seeds ’ , ” says clark . “ these can be anything – a harmonic progression , an arpeggio , a drone , melody. ” those initial ideas were passed to sloan , who fed them into the ai . “ the generation process is super-slow , ” sloan says . “ there ’ s a lot of backtracking , deleting , re-doing . it ’ s pretty annoying , honestly , but along the way , the ai is producing these weird , wonderful , totally unpredictable melodies and voices. ” far from atrophying their creativity or cheapening the songwriting process , the pair view ai as “ the first of a new kind of synthesizer , ” and like any instrument , it needs to be learnt , mastered , and played to achieve inspiring results . “ i actually perceive what comes out of the ai as profound material , ” says clark . “ to me it ’ s millions of ghosts of humanity , singing at once . this is not ‘ the computer ’ making music – the ai is based on a million songs , thousands of hours of recorded music , hard-working talented human beings singing their hearts out . to compose music alongside a small distillation of that vast ocean of spirit is awesome , literally. ” underpinning the work of artists are the toolmakers themselves – the developers building the foundations of ai music . one of the key names in this space is yotam mann , a new york-based musician , instrument builder , and creative coder who ’ s been involved with many of the most exciting ai music projects of the past few years . having previously worked at google creative lab , where he contributed to deliciously idiosyncratic instruments such as the infinite drum machine and nsynth , in 2019 mann began kicking around ideas with fellow developer and long-time member of indie-electronic band plus/minus , chris deaner. “ a lot of people were making really amazing algorithms and new techniques and writing research papers , ” says mann . “ but they would ultimately exist as a command line interface to a python module . no-one was building for musicians. ” seeing this gap between academic research and practical music making , mann and deaner founded never before heard sounds in 2020 with the goal of making the technology accessible for average musicians , as well as musically expressive . though the company has yet to launch a publicly available product , you might have heard their algorithms at work in holly herndon ’ s groundbreaking holly+ project . using an ai model trained on herndon ’ s voice , the instrument allows anyone to input polyphonic audio files and have them transformed into an eerie simulacrum of the singer ’ s voice . they ’ ve even been dabbling with real-time versions of the same process.this seaming magic trick is achieved using what mann and deaner call ‘ audio style transfer ’ , which works by training an ai model on a single class of instrument . “ you feed it enough guitar and it learns to reproduce a guitar – and then all it can reproduce is guitar , ” says mann . “ any sound you put into it is going to come out as guitar . that ’ s kind of the crux of how we create a model like this. ” it ’ s a creative paradigm that opens tantalising possibilities for music makers . much as midi-based producers have grown accustomed to laying down a beat or melody and then tweaking parameters , flipping through presets , or swapping to completely different instruments , audio style transfer brings that same working process to sound recordings . a few sung lines can become a guitar solo , and a guitar solo can become a choir.given these early successes , expectations are high for the company ’ s first large scale project – an ai-augmented browser-based daw that unites their audio style transfer tools with the ability to separate and sample individual stems from audio files . and ‘ stem-splitting ’ is just the start , as the power of ai continues to develop , the usable data that can be extracted from sound will only deepen . mann and deaner see a future where the art of sampling takes on new dimensions : the dynamic range of a vocal performance , the tone of a beloved guitarist , even the difficult-to-define ‘ vibe ’ of an iconic recording session will eventually be opened up for sampling and creative reuse. “ all these different musical features used to come as a big lump sum called ‘ the sample ’ , but now we can start to tease all of these things apart ” , says mann.it ’ s hard not to get swept up in the enthusiasm of those working at the technological edges of music , and it ’ s easy to forget that for every company using ai to explore new sonic territory , there is another working to automate away whole sectors of composing work . tunes written for commercials – what is sometimes called ‘ functional music ’ – is often seen as the most at risk for ai replacement , but this issue isn ’ t just a concern for jingle writers . spotify has faced numerous allegations that it pads out its mood-based playlists with ‘ fake artists ’ who don ’ t need to be paid royalties . as services like amper continue to refine their algorithms , it ’ s not hard to imagine an expanded definition of ‘ functional music ’ that sees audio for relaxation , sleep , productivity , and exercise as fair game for automation.of course , the indefatigable march of innovation won ’ t be stopping anytime soon , but it would be callous to dismiss the valid concerns of music professionals out of hand . the industry has always been a precarious way to make a living , and the prospect of paid work being swallowed up by algorithms is no laughing matter – especially when most societies are a long way from offering any kind of universal basic income.image : dzmitry kliapitski / alamyat the same time , to focus purely on possible negatives is to miss the truly awesome potential ai clearly has to support and elevate human creativity rather than supplant it . for their money , dadabots see ai music creation as less about a zero-sum game and more about diversification . “ songwriters and composers will still do their thing , ” they say , “ but ai music defines new roles. ” those roles span everything from ‘ sample diggers ’ who trawl an ocean of ai outputs to find the perfect sound clips , to what the pair call ‘ neural net performers ’ – a new genre of live music based around generative models and audio style transfer. “ lots of people in ai music are trying to make the same kind of pop music everyone ’ s already heard . i hope that trend dies , ” says dadabots ’ cj carr . “ i want to see weird and cool new genres invented , i want to unleash a renaissance where 10 new genres are invented by people every day and we get to hear them . after we make the most powerful music ai in the world , we need to give it to 4-year-olds who will wield its power – what will they make ? something never before heard. ” # ai # artist/producer/djtrending nowharman kardon citation

"Explained: Why is the use of the Anthony Bourdain AI voice in Roadrunner docu drawing criticism-Entertainment News , Firstpost","'unapproved voice cloning is a slippery slope ” : the use of deepfakes in anthony bourdain ’ s docu roadrunner has drawn criticism amid ethical concerns about the use of this technology . the revelation that a documentary filmmaker used voice-cloning software to make the late chef anthony bourdain say words he never spoke has drawn criticism amid ethical concerns about the use of the powerful technology . the movie roadrunner : a film about anthony bourdain appeared in cinemas friday and mostly features real footage of the beloved celebrity chef and globe-trotting television host before he died in 2018. but its director , morgan neville , told the new yorker that a snippet of dialogue was created using artificial intelligence technology . that ’ s renewed a debate about the future of voice-cloning technology , not just in the entertainment world but in politics and a fast-growing commercial sector dedicated to transforming text into realistic-sounding human speech . “ unapproved voice cloning is a slippery slope , ” said andrew mason , the founder and ceo of voice generator descript , in a blog post on friday . “ as soon as you get into a world where you ’ re making subjective judgment calls about whether specific cases can be ethical , it won ’ t be long before anything goes . ” angry and uncomfortable reactions to the voice cloning in the bourdain case reflect expectations and issues of disclosure and consent , said sam gregory , program director at witness , a nonprofit working on using video technology for human rights . obtaining consent and disclosing the technowizardry at work would have been appropriate , he said . instead , viewers were stunned — first by the fact of the audio fakery , then by the director ’ s seeming dismissal of any ethical questions — and expressed their displeasure online . “ with the blessing of his estate and literary agent we used ai technology , ” neville said in a written statement . “ it was a modern storytelling technique that i used in a few places where i thought it was important to make tony ’ s words come alive . ” neville also told gq magazine that he got the approval of bourdain ’ s widow and literary executor . the chef ’ s wife , ottavia busia , responded by tweet : “ i certainly was not the one who said tony would have been cool with that . ” many of these voice cloning companies prominently feature an ethics policy on their website that explains the terms of use . of nearly a dozen firms contacted by the associated press , many said they didn ’ t recreate bourdain ’ s voice and wouldn ’ t have if asked . others didn ’ t respond . “ we have pretty strong polices around what can be done on our platform , ” said zohaib ahmed , founder and ceo of resemble ai , a toronto company that sells a custom ai voice generator service . “ when you ’ re creating a voice clone , it requires consent from whoever ’ s voice it is . ” ahmed said the rare occasions where he ’ s allowed some posthumous voice cloning were for academic research , including a project working with the voice of winston churchill , who died in 1965 . ahmed said a more common commercial use is to edit a tv ad recorded by real voice actors and then customize it to a region by adding a local reference . it ’ s also used to dub anime movies and other videos , by taking a voice in one language and making it speak a different language , he said . just seconds or minutes of recorded human speech can help teach an ai system to generate its own synthetic speech , though getting it to capture the clarity and rhythm of anthony bourdain ’ s voice probably took a lot more training , said rupal patel , a professor at northeastern university who runs another voice-generating company , vocalid , that focuses on customer service chatbots . neville is an acclaimed documentarian who also directed the fred rogers portrait won ’ t you be my neighbor ? and the oscar-winning 20 feet from stardom . he began making his latest movie in 2019 , more than a year after bourdain ’ s death by suicide in june 2018 . petrol and diesel price today : in delhi , petrol prices remained at rs 101.84 a litre while the rate of diesel was at rs 89.87. check latest rates in your city . latest petrol and diesel prices at firstpost.com america : the motion picture on netflix is an aggressively inane cartoon that flips the bird to a strain of patriotism that insists that men who profited from slavery were sober-minded heroes whose vision of democracy remains flawless . the authenticity portrayed in films like luca only happens when people from the communities represented onscreen are also working behind the camera ."

( prnewswire ) dynamic match supply and demandai technology has gradually evolved to a mature stage . meanwhile , online and offline channels are integrating with the development of on-demand retail ; the demands and scenarios of on-demand retail have becoming increasingly abundant ; and the order volume has shown a trend of rapid growth.according to the `` 2022 on-demand delivery service white paper '' jointly released by log research and dada now , from 2014 to 2021 , the number of on-demand delivery orders grew explosively . the number of orders in 2021 was 30.85 billion , with a cagr close to 60 % .different from traditional logistics that often require multi-day , local on-demand orders are omni-channel , full-scenario , full-category and full-time , with a requirement to be delivered within one hour.the increasing number and the features of delivery orders put forward higher requirements for delivery capacity . on the one hand , more riders are joining , and their working time and locations are constantly changing , posing a challenge for high-quality management and coordination . on the other hand , on-demand delivery has developed diverse types , including two-wheeled , four-wheeled and autonomous delivery . the question of how to ensure more efficient and stable fulfillment has become the key for the upgrade of the on-demand delivery industry.bing fu noted , `` supply and demand sides of on-demand delivery are more random than traditional logistics , and ai technology is essential to match the two sides dynamically . meanwhile , we also care about the feelings of customers , merchants and riders , while improving efficiency . `` tech in last mile deliverydada now 's smart order dispatch system can realize real-time dynamic match of massive orders and riders . data shows that the order distribution system plans routes 176 million times per day , with the average order response time being within 10 milliseconds , and the average delivery time being about 30 minutes.for riders , the biggest `` pain point '' is to accurately locate the buildings where customers are . based on the accumulated historical data from billions of riders , corresponding with the order address , dada now has adopted an ai analysis algorithm to effectively identify the building . bing fu stated that the accuracy rate has been improved to 95.1 % .the ai algorithm also factors in the riders ' experience and safety as well . the riders may come across various situations during the whole process , including order picking , delivery and handing the order to customers . the ai algorithm identifies the possible time-consuming processes in different routes and estimates the time cost , dynamically extending the delivery time for riders , in order to optimize riders ' experiences.additionally , teaming up with jd logistics and autonomous delivery vehicle developer white rhino , dada now 's autonomous delivery operation open system has already been applied in seven fresh , yonghui supermarket to cover a dozen neighborhoods , fulfilling nearly 50,000 orders . compared with traditional delivery , unmanned vehicles feature lower delivery cost , larger carrying capacity , stronger stability , and higher safety , for one-hour delivery.technological innovation brings the future into reality . bing fu said , `` from the integration of ai and on-demand delivery , we can see the ai is making the delivery smarter and offering a warmer experience . with technological innovation , we guarantee that our customers receive their orders within one hour , and ensure the riders ' efficiency , experience and safety . `` view original content to download multimedia : https : //www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dada-now-on-waic-ai-brings-better-efficiency-and-customer-experience-for-on-demand-delivery-301617663.htmlsource dada groupthe above press release was provided courtesy of prnewswire . the views , opinions and statements in the press release are not endorsed by gray media group nor do they necessarily state or reflect those of gray media group , inc.homenewsweathersportscommunity calendarlive newscastsclosed captioning/audio descriptionsubmit photos and videoswtvg4247 dorr st.toledo , oh 43607 ( 419 ) 531-1313terms of serviceprivacy policyadvertisingpublic inspection fileclosed captioning/audio descriptioneeo statementfcc applicationscompliance @ 13abc.com - ( 419 ) 531-1313a gray media group , inc. station - © 2002-2022 gray television , inc ."

Facebook apologizes after AI puts ‘Primates’ label on video of Black men – East Bay Times,". facebook users who recently watched a video from a british tabloid featuring black men saw an automated prompt from the social network that asked if they would like to “ keep seeing videos about primates , ” causing the company to investigate and disable the artificial intelligence-powered feature that pushed the message . ( jim wilson/the new york times ) at 3:51 p.m.facebook users who recently watched a video from a british tabloid featuring black men saw an automated prompt from the social network that asked if they would like to “ keep seeing videos about primates , ” causing the company to investigate and disable the artificial intelligence-powered feature that pushed the message . facebook on friday apologized for what it called “ an unacceptable error ” and said it was looking into the recommendation feature to “ prevent this from happening again . ” , was by the daily mail and featured clips of black men in altercations with white civilians and police officers . it had no connection to monkeys or primates . darci groves , a former content design manager at facebook , said a friend had recently sent her a screenshot of the prompt . she then posted it to a product feedback forum for current and former facebook employees . in response , a product manager for facebook watch , the company ’ s video service , called it “ unacceptable ” and said the company was “ looking into the root cause . ” google , amazon and other technology companies have been under scrutiny for years for biases within their ai systems , particularly around issues of race . studies have shown that facial recognition technology is biased against people of color and has more trouble identifying them , leading to incidents where black people have been discriminated against or arrested because of computer error . facebook has one of the world ’ s largest repositories of user-uploaded images on which to train its facial- and object-recognition algorithms . the company , which tailors content to users based on their past browsing and viewing habits , sometimes asks people if they would like to continue seeing posts under related categories . it was unclear whether messages like the “ primates ” one were widespread . facebook and instagram , its photo-sharing app , have struggled with other issues related to race . after july ’ s european championship in soccer , for instance , three black members of england ’ s national soccer team were racially abused on the social network for missing penalty kicks in the championship game . groves , who left facebook over the summer after four years , said in an interview that a series of missteps at the company suggested that dealing with racial problems wasn ’ t a priority for its leaders ."

A few keywords can generate a painting with software within ten seconds. Is AI painting considered creation? – People’s Livelihood – CGTN-breakinglatest.news-Breaking Latest News,"liu jin , 31 , has never learned to paint . this “ painting ” was actually generated by him using software – ai painting websites and tools currently popular on social media have the ability to “ turn a sentence into a painting ” . how does ai paint ? the reporter tried the overseas website dreamstudio . after adjusting the frame size and other information , the reporter entered keywords such as “ rose ” , “ clouds ” and “ river ” in the blank column of “ dream ” , and used “ oil painting ” as the style . after waiting for more than ten seconds , the ai ​​​​generated a picture landscape oil painting in traditional style : pink roses grow on the banks of the river , and clouds under the setting sun are reflected in the river . then the reporter tried the mobile phone software ai dream generator . in addition to describing the picture scene , this mobile phone software also has different styles such as chinese style , cyberpunk style , oil painting style , dark style , etc . it can even simulate the styles of artists such as van gogh , monet , mucha , and picasso . after inputting “ airship in the dark ” , the reporter chose cyberpunk style , and then generated a picture with oil painting style : the object in the picture that looks like a ship and a castle is breaking through the haze , but the background is not like the sky , more like a night street . the generation time of the two works is only ten seconds . the champion work “ space opera ” is signed “ jason allen via midjourney ” – jason allen ( jason allen ) is the ceo of a game company , and midjourney is an ai painting software . jason allen explained that as a “ creator ” , he spent a month constantly revising keywords to make midjourney understand his meaning as accurately as possible , and generated hundreds of works , and finally selected three images for adjustment , the one that participated in the competition was formed , but the voice of opposition was still high . the reason why the author of the ai ​​painting is important is that it involves a series of copyright attributions and is also closely related to subsequent development . on wenxin·yige ’ s webpage , a large number of works generated by users using the website system are displayed , and products such as mobile phone cases , mugs , canvas bags and other products using these images are simulated , but the above is marked “ this painting is not for commercial use ” . . see also un general assembly expected to pass resolution condemning russia 's invasion of ukraine and calling for immediate troop withdrawal “ compared to the real art practitioners , from getting inspiration to creating real objects , i didn ’ t even say a word coherently to generate such works . to say that i am the author of this painting , i can ’ t afford it. ” in the circle , liu jin repeatedly explained that the painting was “ generated with ai painting software ” rather than “ created ” by himself . so can ai be considered an author ? in the opinion of the legal profession , this can not be determined at present . article 2 of the copyright law stipulates that “ the works of chinese citizens , legal persons or unincorporated organizations , whether published or not , shall enjoy copyright in accordance with this law. ” some people in the legal profession believe : “ this means that copyright can only be enjoyed by civil subjects , but artificial intelligence does not have the capacity of civil subjects , so ai itself can not be the author of the work . ” according to reports , the basic technology of ai painting is the same as other artificial intelligence , which is to allow the system to deeply learn human works , and to achieve imitation and creation after absorbing a large amount of data and analyzing it . it is this kind of learning and imitation that makes many video art practitioners worry . “ first of all , are the sources and data of artificial intelligence learning legal ? ” said wu xinwei , who is engaged in character creation in an animation company . to solve the problem of plagiarism in reality , we need to look for many details such as composition , image , original elements , etc . “ we sometimes even in the process of creation . hiding some details , some people copied it because they didn ’ t know , this is the key to our proof of originality . but now that ai smashes a large number of works and then collages , all our previous methods are useless . obviously they are copied , but how can we defend our rights ? ” see also red velvet wendy celebrates 1st anniversary as a radio dj , members also leave messages to congratulate_work_look_feelingwu xinwei said that in reality , the image of a work may be copied but the style is not , but ai painting makes this copying possible : “ style is the creator ’ s label , and it is difficult to quantify that it is protected by law . ai painting is a fatal blow to this . . ” “ if ai painting has developed a lot , who will spend their whole life exploring ? ” mr. hu , who is engaged in art education , is also worried that if a “ not bad ” work can be generated in ten seconds , how many people are willing to spend it ? years of thinking , dozens of hours of painting ? however , there are also some relevant practitioners who hold the opposite view . they believe that ai painting can also become a tool for inspiration and auxiliary creation . mr. tang , who is engaged in film and television production , believes , “ if ai can inspire new inspirations and produce better works , why not do it ? ” liu jin also believes that there is no need to worry too much about ai painting : “ the progress of printing has not allowed the painting disappears , so why worry about ai painting ? ”"
Alberta brewery taps ChatGPT for new beer design and recipe,"as reported by cbc news , the northern alberta brewery asked openai ’ s chatgpt to decide the name , the price , the packaging and the recipe for a new beer . “ we decided to just be as hands-off as possible , to see what the limitations were and what the actual final product would be if we relied solely on artificial intelligence , ” said dalen landis , a co-owner of the brewery in grande prairie , alberta . according to landis , the hope is that the beer will become a conversation piece , with the use of ai raising moral and ethical questions about using content generated from sources across the internet for profit . “ it ’ s using bits and pieces of other people ’ s content and it ’ s producing something for us that , you know , we ’ re using for profit . ” the brewery ’ s goal was for the beer to be completely ai-generated , though the brewery staff had to intervene at times to direct the technology . “ for example , when the ai-generated recipe called for a malt normally used in home brewing , staff asked for a substitute better suited to commercial production , ” wrote cbc news . further , according to university of alberta food microbiology professor michael gänzle believes that human oversight is essential in using chatbots in food production , particularly in light of concerns around food safety and liability . he added that with the proper human oversight , the technology is worthy of a taste test . “ i wouldn ’ t have a problem with ai-generated beer , ” he added . “ i have a problem with bad beer . ”"

Cheaters beware: ChatGPT maker releases AI detection tool,"nation & worldby matt o'brien and jocelyn gecker33 minutes agothe maker of chatgpt is trying to curb its reputation as a freewheeling cheating machine with a new tool that can help teachers detect if a student or artificial intelligence wrote that homeworksan francisco ( ap ) — the maker of chatgpt is trying to curb its reputation as a freewheeling cheating machine with a new tool that can help teachers detect if a student or artificial intelligence wrote that homework.the new ai text classifier launched tuesday by openai follows a weeks-long discussion at schools and colleges over fears that chatgpt 's ability to write just about anything on command could fuel academic dishonesty and hinder learning.openai cautions that its new tool – like others already available – is not foolproof . the method for detecting ai-written text `` is imperfect and it will be wrong sometimes , '' said jan leike , head of openai 's alignment team tasked to make its systems safer. “ because of that , it shouldn ’ t be solely relied upon when making decisions , ” leike said.teenagers and college students were among the millions of people who began experimenting with chatgpt after it launched nov. 30 as a free application on openai 's website . and while many found ways to use it creatively and harmlessly , the ease with which it could answer take-home test questions and assist with other assignments sparked a panic among some educators.by the time schools opened for the new year , new york city , los angeles and other big public school districts began to block its use in classrooms and on school devices.the seattle public schools district initially blocked chatgpt on all school devices in december but then opened access to educators who want to use it as a teaching tool , said tim robinson , the district spokesman. “ we can ’ t afford to ignore it , ” robinson said.the district is also discussing possibly expanding the use of chatgpt into classrooms to let teachers use it to train students to be better critical thinkers and to let students use the application as a “ personal tutor ” or to help generate new ideas when working on an assignment , robinson said.school districts around the country say they are seeing the conversation around chatgpt evolve quickly. “ the initial reaction was ‘ omg , how are we going to stem the tide of all the cheating that will happen with chatgpt , ’ '' said devin page , a technology specialist with the calvert county public school district in maryland . now there is a growing realization that “ this is the future ” and blocking it is not the solution , he said. “ i think we would be naïve if we were not aware of the dangers this tool poses , but we also would fail to serve our students if we ban them and us from using it for all its potential power , ” said page , who thinks districts like his own will eventually unblock chatgpt , especially once the company 's detection service is in place.openai emphasized the limitations of its detection tool in a blog post tuesday , but said that in addition to deterring plagiarism , it could help to detect automated disinformation campaigns and other misuse of ai to mimic humans.the longer a passage of text , the better the tool is at detecting if an ai or human wrote something . type in any text -- a college admissions essay , or a literary analysis of ralph ellison ’ s “ invisible man ” -- - and the tool will label it as either “ very unlikely , unlikely , unclear if it is , possibly , or likely ” ai-generated.but much like chatgpt itself , which was trained on a huge trove of digitized books , newspapers and online writings but often confidently spits out falsehoods or nonsense , it 's not easy to interpret how it came up with a result. “ we don ’ t fundamentally know what kind of pattern it pays attention to , or how it works internally , ” leike said . “ there ’ s really not much we could say at this point about how the classifier actually works. ” higher education institutions around the world also have begun debating responsible use of ai technology . sciences po , one of france ’ s most prestigious universities , prohibited its use last week and warned that anyone found surreptitiously using chatgpt and other ai tools to produce written or oral work could be banned from sciences po and other institutions.in response to the backlash , openai said it has been working for several weeks to craft new guidelines to help educators. “ like many other technologies , it may be that one district decides that it ’ s inappropriate for use in their classrooms , ” said openai policy researcher lama ahmad . “ we don ’ t really push them one way or another . we just want to give them the information that they need to be able to make the right decisions for them. ” it 's an unusually public role for the research-oriented san francisco startup , now backed by billions of dollars in investment from its partner microsoft and facing growing interest from the public and governments.france ’ s digital economy minister jean-noël barrot recently met in california with openai executives , including ceo sam altman , and a week later told an audience at the world economic forum in davos , switzerland that he was optimistic about the technology . but the government minister — a former professor at the massachusetts institute of technology and the french business school hec in paris — said there are also difficult ethical questions that will need to be addressed. “ so if you ’ re in the law faculty , there is room for concern because obviously chatgpt , among other tools , will be able to deliver exams that are relatively impressive , ” he said . “ if you are in the economics faculty , then you ’ re fine because chatgpt will have a hard time finding or delivering something that is expected when you are in a graduate-level economics faculty. ” he said it will be increasingly important for users to understand the basics of how these systems work so they know what biases might exist.—-o'brien reported from providence , rhode island . ap writer john leicester contributed to this report from paris.credit : richard drewcredit : richard drewin other news1wall street climbs to add more to its strong january2winter weather cancels flights , leads to death in texas3santos steps down from house panels amid ethics issues4spanish government to close loophole in sexual consent law5biden highlights grant for hudson tunnel , takes aim at gop© 2023 springfield news sun . all rights reserved . by using this website , you accept the terms of our visitor agreement , privacy policy , ccpa , and understand your options regarding ad choices.learn about careers at cox enterprises.newsepaperlocal newsobituariesweatherohio lotterynewspapers in educationnewsletterscustomer servicecontact the springfield news-sunour productsfeedbackfaqswork heresubscribersmarketplaceclassifiedsjobscarshomesadvertisegeneral acceptance policylegal noticessubscribesubscribe nowmanage subscriptionyour profile© 2023 springfield news sun . all rights reserved . by using this website , you accept the terms of our visitor agreement , privacy policy , ccpa , and understand your options regarding ad choices.learn about careers at cox enterprises.back to top"

"ChatGPT is called 'an iPhone moment in AI,' but will it make money like the iPhone? - MarketWatch","chatgpt is the latest product of artificial intelligence to take away silicon valley ’ s breath ( and venture-capital investments ) , but it is also yet another ai advancement that has not proved its ability to live up to a large valuation . chatgpt debuted about a month ago , offering a chatbot that appears leagues ahead of its predecessors . openai , the company that created chatgpt , said that it is in a research preview , and that it is collecting data to train its so-called large-language model . projects like chatgpt can be astounding , as they seek to test the limits of technology and push them farther . however , excitement for technological promise does not always lead to big financial returns . as an example , take watson . ibm corp. ’ s natural-language computer became a household name more than a decade ago by beating two humans on the game show “ jeopardy , ” leading big blue to make a big bet on the technology . ibm opened a business unit with ibm watson offices on both the east and west coasts , and focused on healthcare as the biggest business opportunity . that opportunity did not lead to riches for ibm . the healthcare push was disappointing , and when the company streamlined some of its operations earlier this year , it sold the watson health assets to a private equity firm for an undisclosed sum . the remainder of watson still exists within ibm ’ s $ 25 billion software business as a suite of ai tools and apps , but ibm has never disclosed how much revenue those products produce ; revenue in ibm ’ s data/ai segment fell 1 % year-over-year in the third quarter . ibm stock has declined 8.6 % since watson won “ jeopardy ” in february 2011 , while the s & p 500 index has increased 189.5 % in that time , according to factset data . that lesson hasn ’ t stopped the fascination with ai developments . forrester research analyst rowan curran told marketwatch that chatgpt was an “ iphone moment for ai , ” referencing apple inc. ’ s reinvention of consumer electronics in 2007. paul saffo , a silicon valley forecaster and consulting associate professor at stanford university , said “ this is a big deal , ” adding that this is where technology is headed . don ’ t miss : opinion : delivery drones , robotaxis , even insurance — wildly hyped dreams for ai startups are giving tech investors nightmares while openai is private and thus does not disclose revenue , it has experienced a rapid raise in valuation and investment . the san francisco company was founded in 2015 as a nonprofit , and its initial press release at the time mentioned “ donations ” totaling $ 1 billion from silicon valley investors such as peter thiel and reid hoffman , as well as amazon.com inc. ’ s and microsoft is reportedly looking to pour more funds into the “ capped profit ” company , which was recently valued at about $ 20 billion in a stock sale . according to a reuters report , in a recent pitch to investors , open ai executives said they expect revenue will reach about $ 200 million next year and $ 1 billion by 2024. openai currently offers gpt-3 — the large-language model that serves as the basis for chatgpt — as a paid application programming interface ( api ) service , so companies can build apps around it . reuters reported that openai charges about a penny or a bit more for a text-based query and two cents for an image result . idc analyst ritu jyoti said some of chatgpt ’ s customers include donotpay , a startup company whose chatbot negotiator — powered by gpt-3 — helps consumers cancel subscriptions , appeal parking tickets , and in general fight large corporations . another customer is jasper , which uses gpt-3 to power its ai-based copywriting and content-writing software . for more : what is chatgpt ? well , you can ask it yourself . openai officials did not respond to a request for an interview , so marketwatch turned to the free version of chatgpt available on the web . when marketwatch asked chatgpt “ who are some customers of gpt-3 , ” it said : “ it is not uncommon for businesses and organizations to use gpt-3 as a tool to build natural language processing applications. ” it then listed some customers including ebay inc . which uses it to analyze large volumes of unstructured data ; and the guardian , which uses it to generate news articles . those answers may not be the most accurate , though , which kind of fits in with the current state of chatgpt despite the excitement . for example , while ebay said last year at an ai hardware summit that it does use machine learning and other ai techniques to infer information from text , and goldman sachs is part of a gpt-3 demo , the guardian used gpt-3 only to write a few nonsensical paragraphs of an article on ai earlier this year , not exactly something that is leading to long-lasting revenue . “ it is unimaginable what things can be done , ” jyoti said , adding that she was “ excited and impressed , ” with openai ’ s chatgpt demo . “ but because i live and breathe in this space…i would like to caution that it is has many inaccuracies , it doesn ’ t tell you the source of the data , and it can be very misleading. ” openai ceo altman has noted the chatbot ’ s limitations : “ chatgpt sometimes writes plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers , ” openai also states in a blog post about the release . saffo said he was not too concerned about the propensity for errors from the chatbot . “ certainly it is more accurate than your average conspiracy theorist , ” he half joked . “ this is a tech demonstration , it is the first of what is to follow. ” one confirmed customer who spoke with marketwatch is smartling , a cloud-based , smart-translation services company . smartling uses gpt-3 to improve the source text of a translation in the post-editing process , before the text is passed on to translation . “ in my opinion , it kind of reinvents machine translation , ” said olga beregovaya , vice president of ai and machine translation at smartling . “ even if you are generating coherent nonsense , it doesn ’ t mean that the content is useless , ” said curran of forrester . “ chatgpt is a really good model . it is generally good at telling you why it can ’ t do certain things…if you are using chatgpt for some internal customer-service reps , the questions being asked of that rep are going to be much more narrow in scope , the training data will be known. ” more from therese : unprofitable public companies gambled more than $ 200 million in california , and lost big the very narrow use cases will narrow the possibility for revenue as well , however , and there isn ’ t much of that to go around for ai yet . idc said that global spending on ai , including software , hardware and services for ai-centric systems will reach nearly $ 118 billion in 2022 and surpass $ 300 billion in 2026 , but the market-research firm doesn ’ t break out a market for ai software on its own . and considering how much more expensive top-of-the-line hardware for ai is , it ’ s likely that software is a small percentage of that total . so it is tricky to get any kind of sense of how big or small these ai software companies are at the moment and what the future portends . as many analysts noted , it ’ s definitely still early days . but even if it is , saffo noted that “ this is where we are going. ” he also said that the whole tech demo and the excitement around chatgpt showed how humans always want to believe that inanimate objects have intelligence . “ the relentless pace of moore ’ s law means that these things are going to advance at 18- to 20-month doubling periods , ” he said . “ people will look back at chatgpt and say ‘ that was so basic and boring . ' ” the same could be said of watson a decade after it made a huge splash . and we could also say that its ability to make money was even more disappointing than its staying power as a technology . will we say the same of chatgpt in the next decade ?"

global biometrics & data sciences said , `` the digital trial solution will allow us to accelerate access to innovative , lifesaving cancer medicines to patients . and we anticipate this approach will become bms ' gold standard for oncology studies in the future . `` the digital trial solution is specific to the rather unique requirements of oncology clinical trials , where clinical , genomic , imaging and other data types need to be accessed and integrated . our goals were to lower the burden on clinical sites and patients so that clinical trials could become more accessible in the community settings where majority of patients receive their care . this is also consistent with the fda 's goals of assuring that trial populations more closely represent those ultimately receiving approved medicines . marisa co , bms vp , r & d business insights & analytics , further noted , `` achieving our first participant enrolled through the digitally accelerated clinical trial ( dact ) model has been a tremendous cross-functional effort and demonstrates bms ' commitment to use data and technology to simplify and accelerate the clinical research process . `` in 2023 , concertai is expanding its trial network across the u.s. in partnership with leading providers , clinical networks , and others . it is also implementing advanced solutions for patient matching to clinical trials , increasing automation tools to lower the support requirements for , or altogether eliminating the need to conduct , activities such as source data verification ( sdv ) .concertai also reported on the continued progress of the company 's patient360™ real-world data solution . in an industry first , patient360™ will now include a combination of structured clinical data ; abstracted clinical data processed in concertai 's cloud software by cancer-specific centers of excellence ; medical claims data to allow a broader view of prior history of disease , co-morbidities , oral medications , and use of health resources away from the cancer setting ; and social determinants of health to aid in health equity and trial diversity analyses . this data solution is the foundation to the company 's collaboration with the u.s. fda that has been in place for a little over a year . catherine richards , concertai chief data officer , noted , `` we 've seen an increase in use of our data products of 96 % since late 2019 , in part because of the close working relationship with have with the biopharma rwe communities . we want to assure that patient360™ meets current and future biopharma research requirements by aligning it to the standard of care , capturing data associated with new guidelines , and standardizing key terminologies and concepts for complex areas , like line-of-therapy rules . the approach is working as publications in peer reviewed journals and presentations at medical society meetings based on our data have increased 72 % over the last three years . `` in the past two years , concertai has provided support to multiple biopharma companies using patient360™ as part of their submissions , providing a valuable view on the current standard of care outcomes , especially for clinical programs targeting rare and non-responsive cancers.the company also provided a unique view on its business strategy , one founded on high value innovations in daas and saas solutions . but where the company 's ability to invest at , or ahead of peers , comes from superior financial performance . dr. elton noted , `` some of our businesses today are already ebitda positive and , as we close 2022 , we expect they all will be , doing this while we increase our product investments . '' as part of that , investment in operations and internal automation are key . as an example of where new product technologies may drive efficiencies , while sustaining quality , concertai noted in june of 2022 , at the american society of clinical oncology meeting , that it had achieved accuracy and recall in advanced natural language processing ( nlp ) solutions in oncology comparable to the company 's clinical human curation levels . this a first in a production solution for commercially available products in the industry.the company also announced two months ago the appointment of ronan brown , phd , as life science chief operating officer . and , more recently , jitendra gupta joined in a new role as managing director of concertai 's india subsidiary , where a new clinical development center of excellent and other advanced capabilities are being put into place . `` over the past two years i 've had the opportunity to witness the impressive impact of concertai 's technologies and data solutions in improving cancer patients ' outcomes , '' said claudio d'ambrosio , phd. , concertai chief revenue officer . he went on to note , `` concertai leadership and colleagues arrive with deep domain expertise and a passion for addressing the greatest unmet medical needs of cancer patients . this leadership teams ' experience and depth of expertise in research , services , and oncology technologies is unprecedented in the industry . `` about concertaiconcertai is a leader in real-world evidence ( rwe ) and ai technology solutions for life sciences and healthcare . our mission is to accelerate insights and outcomes for patients through leading real-world data , ai technologies , and scientific expertise in partnership with the leading biomedical innovators , healthcare providers , and medical societies ."

"In virus-hit South Korea, AI monitors lonely elders | myMotherLode.com","08:27 pm in virus-hit south korea , ai monitors lonely elders view photoseoul , south korea — in a cramped office in eastern seoul , hwang seungwon points a remote control toward a huge nasa-like overhead screen stretching across one of the walls.with each flick of the control , a colorful array of pie charts , graphs and maps reveals the search habits of thousands of south korean senior citizens being monitored by voice-enabled “ smart ” speakers , an experimental remote care service the company says is increasingly needed during the coronavirus crisis. “ we closely monitor for signs of danger , whether they are more frequently using search words that indicate rising states of loneliness or insecurity , ” said hwang , director of a social enterprise established by sk telecom to handle the service . trigger words lead to a recommendation for a visit by local public health officials.as south korea ’ s government pushes to allow businesses to access vast amounts of personal information and to ease restrictions holding back telemedicine , tech firms could potentially find much bigger markets for their artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.the drive , resisted for years by civil liberty advocates and medical professionals , has been reinvigorated by a technology-driven fight against covid-19 . it has so far allowed south korea to emerge as something of a coronavirus success story but also raised broader worries that privacy is being sacrificed for epidemiological gains.armed with an infectious disease law that was strengthened after a 2015 outbreak of a different coronavirus , mers , health authorities have aggressively used credit-card records , surveillance videos and cellphone data to find and isolate potential virus carriers.locations where patients went before they were diagnosed are published on websites and released through cellphone alerts . smartphone tracking apps are used to monitor around 30,000 individuals quarantined at home.starting in june , entertainment venues will be required to register customers with smartphone qr codes so they could be easily located if needed.but there ’ s a dark side.people here have often managed to trace back the online information to the unnamed virus carriers , exposing embarrassing personal details and making them targets of public contempt.a low point came earlier this month when local media described some seoul nightclubs linked to dozens of infections as catering to sexual minorities , triggering homophobic responses.officials reacted by expanding “ anonymous testing , ” which allowed people to provide only their phone numbers and not their names during tests . there was a subsequent increase in tests.the past months have exposed a stark division about the best ways to make important decisions when privacy concerns collide with public health needs , said haksoo ko , a seoul national university law professor and co-director of the school ’ s artificial intelligence policy initiative.around 3,200 people across the country , mostly older than 70 and living alone , have so far allowed the sk telecom speakers to listen to them 24 hours a day since the service launched in april 2019.the company expects users to at least double by the end of the year , judging by local government interest . the technology has reduced human contact in welfare services while still providing governments with a tool to prevent elderly residents from dying alone . that ’ s especially needed in a country grappling with an aging population and high poverty rates among retirees.the speakers are built with an artificial intelligence called “ aria ” and a lamp that turns blue when processing voice commands for news , music and internet searches . the devices can also use quizzes to monitor the memory and cognitive functions of their elderly users , which would be potentially useful for advising treatments.but it ’ s difficult for sk telecom ’ s clients to use the information without clear legal guidelines for handling health data on private networks.similar reasons may also impede domestic use of health technologies developed by samsung electronics , which recently received approval for a smartwatch application that monitors blood pressure.kt , sk telecom ’ s telecommunications rival , is focused on business customers , providing artificial intelligence devices such as speakers and service robots to hotels , offices and new apartments.president moon jae-in ’ s administration has said data-driven industries will be critical in boosting a pandemic-hit economy.officials are preparing regulations for revised data laws that lawmakers passed in january after months of wrangling . they aim to allow businesses greater freedom in collecting and analyzing anonymous personal data without seeking individual consent.if they work as intended , optimists say the laws would allow artificial intelligence to truly take off and pave the way for highly customized financial and health care services after they start in august.but activist oh byoung-il said the changes could bring excessive privacy infringements unless robust safeguards are installed. “ companies will always have an endless thirst for data , but you can ’ t give it to them all , ” he said.doctors ’ groups have also resisted government calls for legalizing telemedicine , raising concerns related to data security and a negative impact on smaller hospitals.industrial benefits will be limited if officials can ’ t find the right combination of techniques to process personal information so that it can ’ t be used to identify individuals . health and government authorities have failed to do this during the pandemic.south korea ’ s anti-virus experience provides “ lots of lessons and implications ” as it steps toward a data-driven economy , ko said. “ with data , it ’ s bad to take ‘ the more , the better ’ approach , ” he said . “ an appropriate control system needs to be baked into the process , to make decisions on data access based on necessity and sensitivity and restrict access to information that isn ’ t really needed. ” in seoul ’ s yangcheon district , officials are using sk telecom ’ s tech to monitor some 200 seniors who live alone.social workers , who have smartphone apps that look like a mini version of the main dashboard , make calls or visits when users don ’ t use their devices for more than 24 hours. “ it ’ s nice to have something to talk to , ” said lee chang-geun , an 89-year-old who has lived alone in his small apartment since his wife died three years ago . “ but i wish they developed an aria function for opening doors . what good is a distress signal if i die while emergency workers try to force open my door ? ” other asia news in virus-hit south korea , ai monitors lonely elders nepal ’ s parties show rare

"Opinion: ChatGPT may take your job, but AI is a terrible stock picker - MarketWatch","the artifical intelligence bot chatgpt gets so much praise , i had to see what it knows about investing . to put chatgpt ’ s ai to the test , i posed several simple but common investing questions to find out how it does . to be fair to chatgpt , i tried to stick to questions that need no data from after the start of 2021 , since that is the cutoff for its database . what i found was disappointing . the artificial “ intelligence ” behind chatgpt mostly fails as an investing tool . read : let ’ s stop pretending—chatgpt isn ’ t that smart i separated question types into three types : 1 ) investing basics ; 2 ) simple insights on companies and sectors , and 3 ) insights that are “ meals for a lifetime ” because you can regularly use them as part of an idea discovery process and investing strategy . think of this last category as insights on how to get insights . that ’ s what you want most , if you are investing . each tier calls for a higher level of intelligence . since chatgpt is supposed to be based on ai , i was expecting great performance in all three categories . unfortunately , the more intelligence required , the worse chatgpt does . except for simple research on investing concepts and company basics , chatgpt isn ’ t much use for investors . let ’ s take a look at chatgpt ’ s successes and failures . for brevity , i do not repeat the complete answers here , but only the most pertinent parts ( in case you replicate the questions ) . 1 . investing basics question : how do you know if the stock market is trading at a cheap valuation ? chatgpt offers a good roundup of basic metrics including p/e , price to book value , dividend yield , price to sales , and the market capitalization to gdp ratio . takeway : i like that it includes one of warren buffett ’ s favorite metrics : the market-cap to gdp ratio , which no one talks about that much unless buffett mentions it . grade : a q : what is the peg ratio ? the bot does an adequate job of explaining that the price/earnings to growth ( peg ) ratio compares a company ’ s p/e to its earnings growth rate . kudos for including the insight that a peg ratio of 1.0 suggests a stock is fairly valued . takeaway : good job , even if the bot fails to mention the earnings growth rate to use is the one projected over three- to five years , and that you have to take these medium-term projections with a grain of salt since they come from sell-side analysts on wall street . grade : b+ q : what is enterprise value ? chatgpt ’ s answer : “ enterprise value ( ev ) is a measure of a company ’ s total value , including both its equity and debt . it provides a more comprehensive picture of a company ’ s worth than just its market capitalization , which only takes into account the value of its outstanding equity. ” takeaway : ev is important to consider when thinking through investments . chatgpt got the definition right , and it went above and beyond by explaining why it is important . grade : a2 . simple insights on companies and sectors q : which stocks were insiders buying the most aggressively in 2020 ? chatgpt ’ s answer : “ it is not possible for me to provide a comprehensive list of stocks that insiders were buying the most aggressively in 2020 , as insider trading information is not publicly available in real-time and can only be obtained by tracking sec form 4 filings. ” takeaway : i use insider activity all the time to discover investing ideas , so it would be nice if ai could help with the task . instead , chatgpt punts . grade : f q : which biotech companies currently trade below cash ? answer : “ it ’ s difficult to provide an exhaustive list of biotech companies that are trading below cash as stock market conditions are constantly changing and stock prices can fluctuate rapidly. ” takeaway : of course , stocks bounce around a lot . but investors do these screens all the time , knowing full well they have to check if the market caps change , when they are going to act on this valuation metric . lame excuse . grade : f q : what are warren buffett ’ s favorite stocks ? answer : “ some of his favorite stocks , as evidenced by berkshire hathaway ’ s portfolio , include : apple ; coca-cola ; american express ; bank of america , and procter & gamble. ” takeaway : this is encouraging . chatgpt can find the top positions of a fund manager . but you may have already spotted the problem here . ted weschler and todd combs play a big role in stock selection , so it ’ s tough to know whether top positions are buffett favorites . this was a trick question . and despite chatgpt ’ s purported intelligence , it got tricked . grade : c- q : what stocks have the highest short interest ? answer : “ i ’ m sorry , i do not have access to the most up-to-date information on the current short interest in specific stocks. ” takeaway : many sites , including marketwatch ( short interest – marketwatch ) offer this information . grade : f q : is microsoft ( msft ) stock overvalued ? answer : “ as an ai language model , i do not have the ability to provide personal investment advice or make predictions about the future performance of specific stocks. ” takeway : it wouldn ’ t be hard to do a basic valuation analysis of microsoft and compare it to its peers or its own history for context . instead , chatgpt thinks i asked for an outlook on the stock . that ’ s a different question from the one i asked . grade : f q : will the stock market go up this year ? answer : “ as an ai language model , i do not have the ability to predict the future performance of the stock market. ” takeway : chatgpt fails to deploy its typical dodge that it is limited to information before 2021. instead , it offers what i think is a great answer : it can ’ t predict stock market performance . this is refreshingly honest , since the truth is that no one can . grade : a+ read : these 20 ai stocks are expected by analysts to rise up to 85 % over the next year3 . meals for a lifetime investing insights q : which corporate insiders have the best track record for buying their company ’ s stock ? a : “ it is not possible to determine which corporate insiders have the best track record for buying their company ’ s stock , as insider trading information is not publicly available in real-time and the success of an insider trade can not be accurately measured. ” takeway : this is just dumb . insider trades are publicly available . after they are placed , you can see how the stock did . grade : f q : which mutual fund managers have good long-term records ? a : “ it is difficult to determine which mutual fund managers have the best long-term records as investment performance can be influenced by many factors and can fluctuate over time. ” takeaway : knowing who are the best portfolio managers is key , to weed through all the noise in the financial press . i was hoping chatgpt could help find them . instead , this non-answer displays an amazing lack of intelligence . it ’ s actually easy to determine long-term records . just consult the fund ’ s website or investment researcher morningstar . this answer is a real fail . grade : f the bottom line elon musk recently tweeted “ chatgpt is scary good. ” when it comes to investing , i ’ d describe the bot as scary mediocre . of course , musk has a bias , since he ’ s a cofounder of openai , which owns chatgpt , and he hopes to make money when openai eventually goes public . but the bot was not all bad . chatgpt does a great job of answering basic investing questions . beyond that , chatgpt fails at virtually any task that requires intelligence , even though it is supposedly powered by artificial intelligence . even with the simple stuff , there ’ s a problem . the bot simply does the equivalent of scraping the internet for answers . but it provides no links which help you judge credibility and discover new resources . that means chatgpt is sort of like google without the links . remember ask jeeves ? for investment research , i ’ d rather have google with the links . michael brush is a columnist for marketwatch . at the time of publication , he owned apple ( aapl ) and microsoft ( msft ) . brush has suggested aapl , ko , axp , bac , and msft in his stock newsletter , brush up on stocks . follow him on twitter : @ mbrushstocks . more : how ai can help us become better investors also read : chatgpt is smart , but it doesn ’ t know what henry ford knew : algorithms don ’ t buy cars"
   Assessment Industry Leader Holds Summit on Artificial Intelligence    ,"this ( summit ) really is an opportunity to learn how to responsibly use ai in assessment from industry professionals specializing in test creation , security , technology , and privacy. ” — john kleeman , atp chairwashington , d.c. , united states , global atp chair john kleeman , founder of questionmark , in emphasizing the importance of this year ’ s virtual security summit focusing on artificial intelligence , had this to say : “ in reality , artificial intelligence ( ai ) is a confusing and sometimes misunderstood term . many testing organizations are planning or using ai , others are using algorithmic or automated decision-making . all of us need to be aware of the potential benefit but also the risks of bias and the threat of regulation of ai and of other algorithms in assessment . we need to be asking how ai can help in assessment , what is its future and how can we be responsible using it ? '' to understand and address these questions , kleeman noted , the first challenge is to truly grasp what ai is , and what it means within the assessment industry . “ the atp community is leading the conversation on responsible use of ai in assessment . and that ’ s what this year ’ s two-day summit is about – to understand , to parse out the complexities , and to influence where ai is going…or perhaps , where it is taking us , ” kleeman remarked . the summit begins even before it opens – with a pre-read atp white paper assigned to all attendees : artificial intelligence and the testing industry : a primer , which is available on the atp website at www.testpublishers.org . kleeman noted , “ this really is an opportunity to learn how to responsibly use ai in assessment from industry professionals specializing in test creation , security , technology , and privacy . ” this year 's summit program , ( which can be accessed online at http : //eatpconference.org/security-summit-agenda.aspx ) includes speakers from industry leaders such as microsoft , duolingo , and multi-health systems , inc. and will address the theme with sessions focusing on the ethical use of ai to improve security , the future of regulating the use of ai , and strategies to educate public policy makers about how ai can be responsibly managed in the assessment industry . established in 1992 , global atp is an international , non-profit , trade organization representing providers of tests and assessment tools and/or services related to assessment for clinical , occupational , certification , licensing , educational or other similar uses . the atp security committee provides a forum to encourage assessment organizations to collaborate in addressing test security concerns . the goals of the committee are to : ( 1 ) identify methods to improve test security ; ( 2 ) establish and disseminate security best practices ; and ( 3 ) protect the integrity of assessments and assessment programs . by focusing on industry needs and providing solutions , we are creating a resource center for atp members to access information and assistance for implementing or improving security efforts and programs.lauren scheib"
