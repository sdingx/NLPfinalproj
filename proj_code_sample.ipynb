       " ' /PRNewswire/ -- UltraSight, an Israeli-based digital health pioneer transforming cardiac imaging through the power of artificial intelligence, announced it has obtained a CE Mark for its AI guidance software for cardiac ultrasound. Today\\'s milestone comes just ahead of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Congress in Barcelona and aligns with its call for action to achieve heart health in Europe by 2025.UltraSight(PRNewswire)UltraSight\\'s technology allows medical professionals, regardless of their sonography experience, to successfully capture diagnostic quality ultrasound images of the heart. The technology can be used at the point of care, paving the way for more widespread detection of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and improved access to optimized cardiac care across the continent.The novel AI software pairs with point of care ultrasound devices that are currently on the market and provides the operator with real-time instructions on how to capture high quality diagnostic images. The underlying AI neural network predicts the position of the ultrasound probe relative to the heart, based on the ultrasound video stream only, and guides the user on how to maneuver the probe to ensure that the acquired images are of diagnostic quality.\"UltraSight was founded with the intention to apply the power of machine learning in imaging and put the ability to scan patients into the hands of physicians everywhere,\" said Davidi Vortman, CEO of UltraSight. \"By empowering more medical professionals to accurately scan patients, we will have faster and greater detection of CVD across the continent. This is not only a momentous occasion for UltraSight as a company, but it brings us one step closer to helping the millions of people in Europe who suffer from CVD.\"According to the ESC1, there are 113 million people living with CVD in Europe today. Europe has the highest CVD mortality rate in the world, with approximately four million people succumbing to this disease each year. CVD is the leading cause of death for Europeans.UltraSight obtained CE Mark after results from a clinical study held at the Sheba Medical Center, Israel, validated its technology and confirmed that the software is effective at instructing novice medical professionals to acquire diagnostic-quality cardiac images. The study found that UltraSight AI guidance allowed medical professionals who did not have prior sonography experience to obtain diagnostic quality cardiac images in 100 percent of patients. The study was conducted using the Philips Lumify ultrasound device.\"Many medical residents have entered the healthcare field since the pandemic; however, being able to provide them with the necessary hands-on training and supervision has become challenging for many European emergency departments looking to adopt point of care ultrasound,\" said Prof. Salvatore Di Somma, MD, PhD, Director of Emergency Medicine and Chairman of the Postgraduate School of Emergency Medicine at the Department of Medical-Surgery Sciences and Translational Medicine University of Sapienza in Rome, Italy. \"Supporting new ultrasound users with AI guidance, such as UltraSight\\'s AI guidance software, would increase efficiencies and expedite the learning curve while also reducing the time for obtaining good echocardiographic imaging in the Emergency Room, opening resources for experienced staff to respond to other acute needs.\"\"Point of care ultrasound can be a very useful tool for Intensive Care Unit physicians. Some key hemodynamic measurements, such as Left Ventricular Outflow Tract Velocity Time Integral (LVOT VTI), provide invaluable help to guide fluid therapy. However, some physicians are still reluctant to use it because they consider this measurement a competence reserved for advanced ultrasound operators,\" said Professor Bernard Cholley, ICU Department Head at the Hôpital Européen Georges Pompidou, Paris, France. \"When introduced to UltraSight\\'s AI guidance software, we were very compelled by the prospect of AI supporting more healthcare providers, including novice ultrasound users, to acquire a cardiac ultrasound view by which the LVOT VTI can be measured accurately for a reliable measurement and optimized patient care.\"The UltraSight AI\\xa0Guidance software is indicated for use in two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography (2D-TTE) for adult patients. It is\\xa0intended\\xa0to assist medical professionals in performing cardiac ultrasound scans. UltraSight AI\\xa0Guidance software is an accessory to compatible general-purpose diagnostic ultrasound systems\\xa0and\\xa0is\\xa0intended\\xa0to be used by medical professionals who have received UltraSight\\'s training as described in the user manual.The UltraSight software is expected to become available in Europe in 2023.

       " ' /PRNewswire/ -- Samsara, the pioneer of the Connected Operations Cloud, today released new data that reveals industrial organizations are turning to data insights from technology solutions and AI to address the needs of a shifting workforce.Samsara logo (PRNewsfoto/Samsara)Organizations across the world of physical operations, including transportation, logistics, and warehousing, have been experiencing a surge in demand. Meanwhile, labor shortages in these same industries are also at an all-time high. Companies have been offering both financial and non-financial incentives to attract and retain scarce talent throughout 2021. Now, they are facing the additional pressure of a fast-approaching holiday season, which experts anticipate will further increase demand and exacerbate these existing challenges.Using cohort analysis to control for growth in customer count, Samsara analyzed aggregated data from thousands of customers to show how industrial organizations are addressing demands and building a new, more digitized workforce. Key findings from this analysis include:Fleets supporting physical operations are covering more ground than ever. On average, Samsara logged more than 12 million vehicle location data points per customer in the first nine months of 2021—a 46 percent year-over-year (YOY) increase.Application programming interface (API) connections are helping break down data silos and streamline internal processes and communication for the distributed workforce. Samsara saw a 300 percent YOY increase* in API pings\\xa0to its Connected Operations Cloud. A vast portion of these pings are going to and from Samsara and various transportation management systems (TMSs), helping companies streamline processes and communications related to compliance, routing, and dispatch.Mobile workflows and digital documents are allowing industrial organizations to get new employees up to speed faster and modernize their day-to-day experience, helping to bridge the skills gap. Samsara saw a 48 percent YOY increase* in daily active users of its mobile Driver App, as well as a 100 percent YOY increase* (i.e. doubling) in usage of its digital Documents feature.Industrial organizations are increasingly able to leverage AI to proactively detect potential safety and security risks, automate previously time-consuming tasks, and improve the employee experience. Samsara saw a 13 percent YOY increase* in AI detections per 1,000 miles driven from its vehicle dash cams, as well as a 129 percent increase so far this year* in AI detections from its site security cameras per customer.\"The days of running operations with pen and paper are coming to a close as industrial organizations accelerate their adoption of new technologies,\" said Sowmya Murali, data analytics manager at Samsara. \"Leaders are using technology to shape a new industrial workforce fit to help operations thrive, no matter the challenges they face. At Samsara, we\\'re eager to continue building the solutions they need to improve the employee experience and bring new levels of efficiency to their organization.\"To read the complete analysis of this data and gain additional insights, see here.About the DataSamsara\\'s Connected Operations Platform collects more than 2 trillion sensor data points annually from IoT devices across diverse industries around the world. By organizing and analyzing these large volumes of data at scale—while taking the necessary measures to ensure complete customer privacy—Samsara\\'s data science team reveals insights that customers can apply to their own organizations.For more information about your rights and how we may process personal data, please see our privacy policy. Methodology notes:For each of the metrics produced for this article, we looked at cohorts of customers who joined Samsara prior to the time period examined in order to control for the effects related to our growing customer base.The customer cohorts varied in size but sample sizes were large enough to produce statistically significant trends and ensure complete anonymity of the customer sample.*YOY increases in API pings, daily active users of our Driver App, and usage of our digital Documents feature were calculated by comparing January through September of 2021 (the most recent month for which we have data) to the same time period in the previous year. The YOY increase in dash cam AI detections was calculated comparing the past three months, July through September of 2021, to the same time period in the previous year. The increase in AI detections from site security cameras was calculated from the beginning of this year, January 2021, through the latest month for which we have data, September 2021.About SamsaraSamsara is the pioneer of the Connected Operations Cloud, which allows businesses that depend on physical operations to harness IoT (Internet of Things) data to develop actionable business insights and improve their operations.

These are all questions we ask ourselves on a daily basis and despite much wariness around the safety of technology, when we are in need of help about a delivery or service, we, without much question, hand over personal details to chatbots.About the authorRyan Lester, Senior Director, Customer Experience Technologies at LogMeIn.Chatbots have been designed to make our lives a little easier, with simple verification questions they can answer common customer service inquiries without the need to sit on hold waiting for an agent. But with the rise of GDPR, it is important for organisations to communicate to customers how the data that we provide Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven chatbots is being used and stored. In this new era of chatbot technology and data regulations, businesses need to put themselves under the same scrutiny that customer and regulators will.Transparency establishes trustAs businesses continue to discover new uses for AI-based technology the topic of ethics and transparency is becoming increasingly popular. Most organisations are using this technology to improve the user experience but for every ten examples of tech for good, there will always be someone looking to exploit the technology. For example, using automated chatbots to gather personal customer data and then using it for purposes for which it wasn’t initially intended. With this in mind, it’s important that those who are using it for the right reasons are effectively communicating their ethical use of the technology.\\xa0In a recent survey by Capgemini Research Institute, approximately three in five consumers who perceived their AI interactions with a company to be ethical said that they place higher trust in that company, were more likely to talk to others about the positive experience, and are more loyal to that company. By empowering customers and giving them the control and ability to seek recourse through the use of AI and chatbot technology, businesses are more likely to see return trust from their customers.\\xa0It’s equally as important that businesses are communicating with employees about their use of AI and chatbot technology. When the Capgemini Research Institute surveyed employees they found that 44% have raised concerns about the potentially harmful use of AI systems and 42% objected to the misuse of personal information by AI systems. In order to tackle and prevent issues, CIOs and IT decision makers should ensure they have a clear code of conduct for ethical AI and that they are transparent about the use of AI in the business. At the end of the day, this technology is designed to be making employees lives easier!Is AI bias getting the better of us?The growing use of AI for sensitive information including for hiring and healthcare, has stirred great debate around bias and fairness. Yet human decision making in these and other domains can also be flawed, shaped by individual and societal biases that are often unconscious. Although there are many cases where AI can reduce humans’ subjective interpretation of data, we must remember that chatbots algorithms derive from public data, including news articles and social media. By using public data without checks and balances, AI can incorporate the worst traits of humanity and end up embodying prejudices of the society.Several approaches to enforcing fairness constraints on AI models have emerged but we still have a long way to go. Some of this work has focused on processes and methods, such as “data sheets for data sets” and “model cards for model reporting” which create more transparency about the construction, testing, and intended uses of data sets and AI models. Other efforts have focused on the implementation of assessments and audits to check for fairness before systems are deployed and to review them on an ongoing basis. All of these efforts should be accompanied by ongoing education campaigns to foster a better understanding of the strict legal frameworks that accompany the use of AI and the growing availability of tools to improve fairness.Again, transparency is essential when it comes to the use of AI and chatbots in customer-facing services. It’s vital that businesses understand the limits of AI and are able to communicate in simple terms that AI is not here to fully replace humans. Regardless of future developments, AI will always lack the uniquely human trait of emotional intelligence. Therefore, for every use of AI there will always be a human operating the controls and customers should feel confident that this will not change.Be deliberate with technologyAs AI and chatbot technology continues to evolve, industries should prepare for the new challenges and criticisms that will inevitably come with it. Businesses shouldn’t be scared of this technology, they should be embracing the innovative and exciting opportunities that it presents. AI is a technology that’s developing fast, and it won’t wait for indecisiveness. Businesses need to ensure that they are being deliberate when they use it and transparent with how they use it. If they can do this, customers will place their trust in both you and your chatbot!Keep your passwords safe with the best password manager.',\n",

       " 'SAN FRANCISCO, April  15, 2021  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tecton, the enterprise feature store company and primary contributor to Feast, today announced Feast 0.10, the first feature store that can be deployed locally in minutes without dedicated infrastructure. The new release makes it possible for data scientists to reap the benefits of a functionally complete feature store with no infrastructure overhead or maintenance. Feast has seen strong adoption to date with more than 1,700 GitHub stars and contributions from Agoda, Cimpress, Farfetch, Google Cloud, Tecton and Zulily.\\xa0 “Our data science team is excited for Feast’s new release! The simplified architecture will integrate with our existing infrastructure with minimal effort. Feast will help us centralize our features which promotes consistency, reusability and visibility of our prediction data,” said David Frantz, a senior software engineer at Porch, a home services platform company that connects homeowners with quality home improvement, repair and maintenance professionals.”\\xa0 Feature stores have emerged as a critical component of the infrastructure stack for machine learning (ML). They solve the hardest part of operationalizing ML: building and serving ML data to production. They allow data scientists to build better ML features and deploy these features to production quickly and reliably. Until today, feature stores have not been lightweight or flexible enough to address the needs of individual data scientists and small data teams. Feast 0.10 is delivered as a Python software development kit (SDK) that can be deployed locally in minutes. Furthermore, Feast 0.10 is modular and integrates with existing data stacks, eliminating the burden and requirement of deploying and maintaining dedicated infrastructure. \"Fast follower enterprises need to digitally transform their businesses and compete in a volatile post-COVID-19 environment. ML can help them, provided they implement accurate ML models that avoid infrastructure complexity. Data scientists must transform mountains of data, distil the right features, then use those features to train and deploy models. Feast 0.10 offers an open source feature store to support this--and inevitable retraining and redeployment when the data drifts--on top of existing infrastructure,” said Kevin Petrie, Vice President of Research at Eckerson Group.\\xa0 “We originally open sourced Feast to share our feature store technology and accelerate the deployment of all ML-powered applications. Feast 0.10 is a major milestone towards making feature stores easy to adopt for data teams that are just getting started in their operational ML journey,” said Willem Pienaar, creator and an official committer of Feast and architect at Tecton.\\xa0\\xa0 Pienaar and Mike Del Balso, co-founder and CEO of Tecton, will be giving a live demo of Feast 0.10 and speaking about their shared vision for the future of operational ML at apply(): the ML Data Engineering Conference on April 21 and 22. The virtual conference will feature speakers from 30 organizations including DoorDash, Etsy, Google, Lemonade, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Netflix, Pinterest, Spotify and Stitch Fix.

       " 'Why This Matters: After stops and starts, artificial intelligence technologies now stand poised for a major business breakthrough.As emerging technologies go, artificial intelligence (AI) has certainly taken its time in making its presence felt on the world.Surprising as that may be, the term AI has actually been around for almost 70 years, having been first coined back in 1955 by computer scientist John McCarthy, a.k.a. the ‘father of AI’, the same year Emmett Brown invented time travel in the movie Back to the Future.Since then, AI has experienced a largely stop-start existence, principally due to sporadic funding and below-par technology. In truth, the term AI has (arguably) gained more notoriety for storylines of killer robots (and the occasional Wall-e) hell-bent on destroying mankind than for its practical use and business benefits. But that’s all changing.The Fourth Industrial RevolutionThanks to breakthroughs in computing power, the advent and availability of big data, cloud hosting/storage, highly sophisticated software, and complex algorithms, the potential of AI is now starting to be fulfilled—with the business world being the biggest benefactors.The market has reacted at pace. In recent years, billions of dollars have been invested by many of—if not all—of the world’s leading organizations into AI technologies (and companies), each of them looking to utilize some form of AI technology to future proof and improve their businesses, and/or create a competitive advantageVarious estimates suggest more than $46 billion will be spent on AI services by 2020 by businesses, a figure rising to above $51 billion 12-months later.Where AI Will Have the Greatest and Earliest ImpactE-commerceCustomer Service (including call centers)Healthcare (including lifestyle)AutomotiveCybersecurityFinanceLegalBut What Is AI?Before we go on (for the non-computer scientists out there), it’s perhaps worth clarifying a few things around what AI is and is not. Yes, AI can mean robotics, but the best examples of AI are purely software based rather than having a physical form.There are hundreds, maybe thousands, of often extremely technical and confusing definitions banded around online and in various publications detailing what AI actually provides. Indeed, entire books have been written detailing the subject.For a more technical and detailed description we recommend you visit your local library, or download a copy of one from the many AI authors out there—Nick Bostrom’s “Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies” is a personal favorite of mine.In its most simple form, AI is the study of methods for making computers behave intelligently and being able to replicate various characteristics of humans.These can include identifying objects, sounds, understanding languages spoken, reading, and understanding content such as text and numbers.Machine learning (ML) is another extremely important branch of AI that you\\'ll often hear and read about. ML uses a more cognitive approach, using algorithms that enable it (whatever form factor ‘it’ may be) to combine what it’s been programmed to do, but also the capability of learning for itself through experience.Where We AreDepending on what you have seen, heard, or read (fictional or not), you may have different ideas as to what AI is and is not capable of at this stage. To offer some clarity there are three simple levels to be aware of:1. Weak AIAI capable of demonstrating human intelligence to carry out specific tasks.2. Strong AIAI capable of showing self-awareness, the ability to think and make decisions for itself to the same level as a human being.3. AI Super IntelligenceAI showing superior levels of intelligence to human beings and fully in control of its existence.For now—and for the foreseeable future—only Weak AI is currently relevant, so it’s time to remove any images of a leathered up, sunglasses wearing Arnold Schwarzenegger.AI Terminologies You Need to KnowAlgorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. Algorithms can perform calculation, data processing, and automated reasoning tasks.Chatbot (also known as a talkbot, chatterbot, bot, IM bot, interactive agent, or artificial conversational entity) is a computer program or an artificial intelligence which conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods. Such programs are often designed to convincingly simulate how a human would behave as a conversational partner.Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning or hierarchical learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on learning data representations, as opposed to task-specific algorithms. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised, or unsupervised.A virtual assistant is a software agent that can perform tasks or services for an individual. Sometimes the term \"chatbot\" is used to refer to virtual assistants generally or specifically those accessed by online chat (or in some cases online chat programs that are for entertainment and not useful purposes).Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence in the field of computer science that often uses statistical techniques to give computers the ability to \"learn\" (i.e., progressively improve performance on a specific task) with data, without being explicitly programmed.Robotics is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering and science that includes mechanical engineering, electronics engineering, computer science, and others. Robotics deals with the design, construction, operation, and use of robots, as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing.Speech recognition is the interdisciplinary sub-field of computational linguistics that develops methodologies and technologies that enables the recognition and translation of spoken language into text by computers. It is also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), computer speech recognition or speech to text (STT). It incorporates knowledge and research in the linguistics, computer science, and electrical engineering fields.It’s Already HereExamples of weak AI have widely been adopted by many different businesses and are in use today—you just might not realize it.In fact, it’s a fairly safe bet that you’ve already unknowingly encountered some form of AI and machine learning technology before you started reading this article. Maybe even before you got out of bed.Have you ever used Apple’s personal assistant, Siri? Or Google’s Alexa? Perhaps you’ve noticed how your emails can often now detect questions being asked of you and automatically provide you with a readymade short reply? How about your smart phone that seems to be able to predict sentences you’re about to type as you’re typing?For those that like a bit of online shopping (such as Amazon) or video streaming (Netflix), have you ever wondered how those personalized recommendations are determined? What about Facebook and its ability to not only recognize there are people in the photo you’ve posted, but can sometimes even identify them, too?They’re all using some form of AI, with the intention of bettering their customer’s experience, enhancing their financial opportunities and—unseen externally—improve their efficiency in workplace.AI for All“We are at the cusp of a new revolution, one that will ultimately transform every organization, every industry, and every public service across the world,” said Ralph Haupter, president, Microsoft Asia. “I believe 2018 is the year that this will start to become mainstream, to begin to impact many aspects of our lives in a truly ubiquitous and meaningful way.”You may be forgiven for thinking the implementation of AI is something exclusively for the Fortune 500’s of this world...but you’d be wrong. Today, things are so advanced that there is unlimited growth potential with AI companies designed to support business like yours.In essence, AI is something that can be packaged up and purchased on a monthly basis, like your broadband or phone. This model reduces significant costs associated with more bespoke in-house solutions.It also means the complexity is significantly removed (the ‘it doesn’t matter how it works as long as it works’ approach), meaning you won’t necessarily need to go and employ a qualified and expensive computer scientist.“You don\\'t need to be a mathematics genius or have a PhD in software engineering to make sense of AI for your business,” said Gartner analyst Whit Andrews. “You don\\'t have to make massive investments in infrastructure and personnel in order to start applying AI\\'s potentially transformative technologies.“These technologies will transform the nature of work and the workplace itself,” he added. “Machines will be able to carry out more of the tasks done by humans, complement the work that humans do, and even perform some tasks that go beyond what humans can do. As a result, some occupations will decline, others will grow, and many more will change.”Competitive AdvantageSo, why should you and your business consider implementing AI? Could it be just a fad? Will it really benefit you?The answers are wide, extremely varied, and will be largely unique to your own business. There may be some obvious areas of your business you\\'d like to improve upon—be it financially or operationally motivated.The magnitude and inevitability of AI cannot be ignored, nor underestimated. Many AI experts and professionals have described the potential impact of AI on businesses as being equivalent to the invention an adoption of the personal computer and email.Some suggest that AI can help boost revenues by around 20 percent, while others warn that any business currently not at least thinking about adopting some form of AI could already be two years behind a rival. Further delays could even result in their demise further down the road due to losing a competitive advantage.Do or Die“More than one-third of businesses will not survive the next 10 years,” said John Chambers, the now former CEO of Cisco during a discussion on AI. “Companies should not miss the market transition or business model nor underestimate your competitor of the future—not your competitor of the past.”Ovum principle analyst, Michael Azoff added: “Every business should at a minimum make itself aware of AI progress in its industry.”Getting StartedThe first thing to remember is what the purpose of AI actually is and identifying how it can benefit your business. From speaking to various professionals in the field, it can be narrowed down to two core reasons: solving existing problems and discovering/identifying new opportunities.At its core, AI is fueled by data, which can come in many different forms for many different uses. Emails, newsletters, subscriptions, views to your website, downloads, and sales are just some examples of where data can be collected.On its own, that data may not seem useful. However, contained within, it could be the difference between success and failure or profit and loss. This is where AI comes into play, and where it would be able to—in many instances—do the job of a human.A famous quote within AI circles comes from Michael Palmer of the Association of National Advertisers sums it up well: “Data is just like crude [oil]. It’s valuable, but, if unrefined, it cannot really be used. It has to be changed into gas, plastic, chemicals, etc. to create a valuable entity that drives profitable activity; data must be broken down and analyzed for it to have value.”Today, the bulk of that potentially valuable data held in companies is still not being utilized. “If we look at the amount of data which is actually being analyzed today, only 20 percent of the data we have is searchable and being used productively,” said IBM chairman, president, and CEO Ginni Rometty during a discussion on the subject. “The other 80 percent is held inside companies, generally not being used.”Impact on JobsOne of the more universal drivers for AI is centered around automation—a word often which spreads fear when discussing the risks to people’s professions. Areas like administrative work (such as data processing and data collection) are widely seen as function where AI will support—or even replace—humans.AI and CareersAccording to Oxford University, the following professions each have a 99-percent probability of being replaced by computers in the future.Data Entry KeyersLibrary TechniciansNew Accounts ClerksPhotographic Process Workers and Processing Machine OperatorsTax PreparersCargo and Freight AgentsWatch RepairersInsurance UnderwritersMathematical TechniciansSewers, HandTitle Examiners, Abstractors, and SearchersTelemarketersMeanwhile, the following professions are said to be widely safe from AI replacement.Recreational TherapistsFirst-Line Supervisors of Mechanics, Installers, and RepairersEmergency Management DirectorsMental Health and Substance Abuse Social WorkersAudiologistsOccupational TherapistsOrthotists and ProsthetistsHealthcare Social WorkersSome figures suggest almost half of all activities at work could eventually be automated, while Price Waterhouse Cooper estimates AI powered machines could take up to 30 percent of UK jobs by 2030. The Bank of England has estimated that 15 million jobs may be at risk.“If your work is repetitive and not creative, you will be gone very soon,” was a stark warning Dr. Roman V. Yampolskiy, a professor in the department of computer engineering and computer science at the Speed School of Engineering, University of Louisville.Bart Selman, a professor of computer science at Cornell University, was quoted as saying: “A lot of large companies have middle management jobs where people manage other people at a very low-level in terms of keeping track of things like vacations and sick days. Those jobs I believe are at risk. Jobs that involve a large routine component. If you’ve made the proper investment, you can develop an AI system that can take over a good fraction of those jobs. A lot of big companies have a lot of those positions and will be looking at it.”Examples of automation and loss of jobs can be seen all over the world today. Some of the headline grabbing stories include that of a Japanese law firm, Fukoku Mutual Life, which invested more than $1.7 million building an AI platform with IBM Watson, has used the technology to replace more than 30 staff members. The annual savings for the firm is predicted to be around $1 million a year.“The next wave of economic dislocation won’t come from overseas,” President Barack Obama said in 2017 during his farewell address. “It will come from the relentless pace of automation that makes many good middle-class jobs obsolete.”Spotting an OpportunityAnother major area for AI adoption is within sales. There are now examples of where AI, using natural language processing software and specific algorithms, is able to spot patterns (in data), to identify new opportunities and provide a level of analysis in just a few seconds.This can vary greatly. Examples include gaining greater knowledge on customer’s viewing and buying behavior—i.e, what they’re looking at and when they most likely buy (such as pay day).Another might be identifying the best time to send bespoke marketing and promotional materials or newsletters to specific customers rather than en masse as part of a one-size-fits-all strategy. Another could be automatically identifying cold customers that haven’t transacted with you for a while and send them updates, reminders, or special offers to help get things over the line.The Future of AIThese are just a handful of examples of how and where AI is already proving significant benefits and opportunities for businesses all over the world.It’s important to realize these are all current technologies, with this article designed to demonstrate and educate you as a businessperson, what is available today, rather the stargazing into the future.The AI revolution is here and it will—if it doesn’t already—play a key role in the future of the way your business runs and performs. When you decide to get on board is up to you. I’ll leave you with this quote from Gartner: “As vendors exploit AI software capabilities within business suites, enterprise applications, infrastructure support services, and the customer experience, your organization will need new or updated strategies. Ready or not, AI is coming to you.”Need to Know More?\\xa0Have a burning question about artificial intelligence, or maybe a request for a different topic you’d like to see us tackle?

       " \" 06.40 ESTI took six weeks off to raise a baby and everyone decided it was the time to declare the AI revolution imminent. It’s hard not to take it personally.The tick-tock of new developments, each more impressive than the last – and each arriving on the scene faster than the last – hit its apogee last week with the near-simultaneous announcement of Google’s Bard and Microsoft’s Bing Chat. Since then, there’s been possible permutation of the discourse, from millenarian claims of an imminent AI eschaton to rejection of the entire field as glorified autocomplete.I’m not here to settle that debate. Instead, if 2023 is the year AI changes everything, then early in that year is the time to dig a little deeper into what it is, how it works and why it is what it is. And the best way to do that is to start talking about all those little terms that get left out of mainstream coverage because they’re “too techy”.What the key AI acronyms and jargon really meanNeural networkNeural networks are the fundamental technology at the heart of the AI boom. Think of them as the equivalent of the steam engine in the first Industrial Revolution: a general-purpose technology that can reach out into myriad different industries and use cases and transform them.First conceived in the 1940s, neural networks began as efforts to model animal brains, which are made of millions of simple neurons each connected to a few others. Each individual neuron is extremely simple, but quantity begets quality, and enough of them together can learn to perform complex tasks. And the same is true of artificial neural networks, though those neurons are purely algorithmic ideas rather than physical connections.Like the steam engine, it took decades for the true power of the invention to be understood. A neural network only works with enormous quantities of computing power and data, so they have been curios for most of the last 70 years. That changed at the turn of the millennium, and the age of AI began sputtering slowing into existence.LLMA “large language model”, or LLM, is one of the two major AI approaches that have led to the latest burst of progress in the sector. It describes neural networks that are trained using huge collections of text data, like OpenAI’s GPT series, Google’s PaLM or Meta’s LLaMa. For instance, PaLM uses “high-quality web documents, books, Wikipedia, conversations and GitHub code” to develop an understanding of language.The question an LLM is trying to answer is simple: given a short section of text, what comes next? But performing that task well is incredibly powerful. For one thing, it’s recursive. Once you’ve predicted what comes next, you have a new, slightly longer section of text, which you can feed back into the LLM and repeat the question, generating whole sentences, paragraphs, articles or books.The question is also general purpose. Predicting what comes next for a short chunk of factual English text is different from predicting what comes next for a short chunk of code, or a question, or a poem, or a pair of translated sentences, or a logic puzzle – but the same approach seems to work quite well for all of those tasks. The larger the language model, the better the result: GPT-3 is 1,500 times bigger than GPT-1, and we don’t seem to be close to discovering the limit.Renaissance-style AI-generated portraits made through Stable Diffusion. Composite: Universal Public Domain DedicationGANWhat LLMs have done for text, “generative adversarial networks” have done for images, films, music and more. Strictly speaking, a GAN is two neural networks: one built to label, categorise and rate, and the other built to create from scratch. By pairing them together, you can create an AI that can generate content on command.Say you want an AI that can make pictures. First, you do the hard work of creating the labelling AI, one that can see an image and tell you what is in it, by showing it millions of images that have already been labelled, until it learns to recognise and describe “a dog”, “a bird”, or “a photograph of an orange cut in half, showing that its inside is that of an apple”. Then, you take that program and use it to train a second AI to trick it. That second AI “wins” if it can create an image to which the first AI will give the desired label.Once you’ve trained that second AI, you’ve got what you set out to build: an AI that you can give a label and get a picture that it thinks matches the label. Or a song. Or a video. Or a 3D model.ComputeTraining a new AI model can be expensive. The final creation of GPT-3 took around $10m of computing time, based on OpenAI’s research papers, and left unsaid is how many abortive efforts it took before the final run came out as intended. That hurdle – access to “compute”, or computing power – means that big general-purpose tools like LLMs tend to be the purview of massive companies. As far back as 2018, OpenAI was warning that the amount of compute used in AI training runs was doubling every three-and-a-half months. A year later, for that reason, the company announced that it would be shifting from a nonprofit model because of the need “to invest billions of dollars in upcoming years into large-scale cloud compute”.The UK is a world leader in AI research, thanks to the “golden triangle” of Oxford, Cambridge and London. But academics are often limited in their access to the amount of compute they need to work at the cutting edge, which has led to the commercial gains being captured by the American and Chinese corporate giants with billions to invest. That has led to calls for a government-owned “BritGPT”, built with public funds to provide the compute that UK researchers lack.The ChatGPT bot seen on an iPhone. Photograph: Koshiro K/AlamyBlack boxNeural networks are often described as a “black box”: the more competent they get, the harder it is to work out how they do what they do. GPT-3 contains 175bn “parameters”, each of which describes how strongly or weakly one neuron affects another. But it’s almost impossible to say what any given parameter does for the LLM as a whole.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to TechScapeFree weekly newsletterAlex Hern's weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see our Privacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.after newsletter promotionEven the overall structure of the neural networks is something of a mystery. Sometimes, we can get a glimpse of order. The “T” in GPT stands for “Transformer”, a way of wiring up the neural network to allow it to mimic short-term memory, which obviously makes sense for something that involves reading a sentence a word at a time. But other aspects of neural network design are more trial and error: for instance, it seems that forcing a neural network to “squeeze” its thinking through a bottleneck of just a few neurons can improve the quality of the output. Why? We don’t really know. It just … does.Fine tuningNot everything requires training an AI model from scratch. You can think of the $10m spent on GPT-3 as the cost of teaching an AI to read and write perfect English. But if all you want to do is develop an AI that can, say, write good scientific articles, you don’t need to start from scratch when AIs that can read English already exist: instead, you can “fine tune” those AIs on the specific data you want them to learn from, teaching them hyper-specific skills for a fraction of the cost. But there’s a risk in doing so: such fine tuning inevitably relies on the initial training, which may not have been under your control.AlignmentAt one level, AI “alignment” is a simple question: have we actually trained the AI to do what we want it to do? If we want an AI that can predict which prisoners are likely to reoffend but the AI is using racial profiling as a core part of its decision, we might describe it as “unaligned” with our desires.Sometimes AI can be unaligned because of bad training data, which embeds within it biases and inaccuracies. If an AI is trained to spot reoffenders based on a dataset of prisoners, for instance, it will never know about those who aren’t sent to prison; if it’s trained to speak English with a dataset that includes all of Twitter, it might start spouting idiosyncratic beliefs about the links between Bill Gates, 5G and Covid vaccines.Other times, AI can be unaligned because we’ve asked it the wrong question. An LLM is designed to predict what text comes next, but sometimes that isn’t really what we want: sometimes we would rather have “true” answers than “likely” ones. Sometimes we would rather have answers that don’t repeat racial slurs, or threaten the user, or provide instructions to build bombs. But that isn’t the question we asked the AI.And sometimes alignment is used to mean something more existential. Say you ask an AI to optimise your factory floor to maximise hourly output, and it decides the most important thing to do is ensure no one interrupts production for the next billion years, so it hides in its plans technology that would kill every organic life form on the planet – that would also be an unaligned AI.The wider TechScapeThe result of a crochet pattern for a narwhal using ChatGPT.

In seconds, consultants are conjuring decks and memos, marketers are cranking out fresh copy and software engineers are debugging code.Almost 30% of the nearly 4,500 professionals surveyed this month by Fishbowl, a social platform owned by employer review site Glassdoor, said that they’ve  already used OpenAI’s ChatGPT or another artificial intelligence\\xa0program in their work. Respondents include employees at Amazon, Bank of America, JPMorgan, Google, Twitter and Meta. The chatbot uses  generative AI to spit out human-like responses to prompts in seconds, but because it’s been trained on information publicly available from the internet, books and Wikipedia, the answers aren’t always accurate.\\xa0While ChatGPT set certain corners of the internet ablaze when it launched for public use in November, awareness is still filtering out to the broader public. Experts anticipate that this kind of AI will be transformative: ChatGPT will become the “calculator for writing,” says one top Stanford University economist.\\xa0Microsoft is in talks with OpenAI about investing as much as $10 billion. The software giant is also\\xa0looking to integrate GPT, the language model that underlies ChatGPT, into its widely-used Teams and Office software. If that happens,\\xa0AI tech may very well be brought into the mainstream.Marketing professionals have been particularly keen to test-drive the tool: 37% said they’ve used AI at work. Tech workers weren’t far behind, at 35%. Consultants\\xa0followed with 30%.\\xa0Many are using the technology to draft emails, generate ideas, write and troubleshoot bits of code and summarize research or meeting notes.\\xa0\\xa0CEOs are using ChatGPT to brainstorm and compose their emails, too. “Anybody who doesn’t use this will shortly be at a severe disadvantage. Like, shortly. Like, very soon,” said Jeff Maggioncalda, chief executive of online learning platform Coursera told\\xa0CNN.\\xa0“I’m just thinking about my cognitive ability with this tool. Versus before, it’s a lot higher, and my efficiency and productivity is way higher.”The speed and versatility of the tool\\xa0has dazzled many users. “I discovered ChatGPT about a month ago,” one person who identified themselves as a chief executive officer\\xa0posted on FishBowl. “I use it every day. It has changed my life. And my staffing plan for 2023.”Read More: Is ChatGPT an\\xa0Eloquent Robot or a Misinformation Machine?Some are even leaning on it as a crutch:\\xa0One newly hired product manager at a fintech firm asked for advice on FishBowl, saying they were “100% lost” in their new role. “Fake it till you make it like you did the interview. When in doubt, ask ChatGPT,” came the reply.Amid the excitement, researchers have sounded notes of caution.While much of the anxiety has concentrated on what ChatGPT means in education —\\xa0New York City public schools have banned its use — experts say companies need to think through their policies for the new tool sooner rather than later. If they don’t, they risk some of the pitfalls ChatGPT and other AI models can introduce, like factual errors, copyright infringement and leaks of sensitive company information.The tech is here to stay, though, and will likely become ever-more pervasive.\\xa0Many AI-assisted programs already exist, and with OpenAI set to release the API, or application programming interface, the number of specialized applications built on the tool will multiply.While some professionals\\xa0aren’t sold on the practicality of the use cases or quality of the output, others are convinced workers are only a few years away from being supplanted by the technology. “If ChatGPT starts making slides, I am done for,” one Deloitte employee wrote. (“Sorry bro… Already exists,” two others wrote back.)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com©2023 Bloomberg L.P.ADVERTISEMENT',\n",

       " ' | 9:48 AM ISTFollow UsListen to This Article Italian regulators have ordered Microsoft-owned OpenAI to immediately stop the processing of Italian users\\' data to general AI models.  The Italian regulator Garante said it\\'s concerned that the ChatGPT maker is breaching the European Union\\'s (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and has opened a probe.  OpenAI will have to notify the Italian regulators within 20 days of the measures implemented to comply with the order, otherwise a fine of up to 20 million euros or 4 per cent of its total worldwide annual turnover may be imposed.  \"There is no way ChatGPT can continue to process data in breach of privacy laws. The Italian SA has imposed an immediate temporary limitation on the processing of Italian users\\' data by OpenAI, the US-based company developing and managing the platform. An inquiry into the facts of the case was initiated as well,\" the regulator noted.  OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, late last month admitted that some users\\' payment information may have been exposed earlier this week when it took ChatGPT offline owing to a bug.  It\\'s worth noting that OpenAI does not have a legal entity established in the EU.  Any data protection authority can intervene under the GDPR if it sees risks to local users.  Finally, the Italian regulators emphasised that the lack of age verification mechanism exposes children to receiving responses that are absolutely inappropriate to their age and awareness, even though the service is allegedly addressed to users aged above 13 according to OpenAI\\'s terms of service.

It\\'s common to hear even the largest enterprises take nine to 12 months to deploy an AI model once the data scientists have completed their models. According to IDC, an estimated 28% of AI/ML projects fail, in part due to lack of staff with the necessary experience.Furthermore, having a black-box AI running in production and making decisions that are hard to comprehend elicits fears and concerns on whether these AI models could make judgements that would have negative consequences for the enterprise.

       " 'ChatGPT has been going from strength to strength recently but a new study may have finally found its limits.Northern Irish firm SG Murphy Solicitors pitted the popular chatbot against high street lawyers in a number of legal scenarios and found that it struggled to compete.One of the big problems they encountered was that 9% of the chatbot’s answers were factually incorrect. Though to be fair to the bot, the limitation list on its website includes the disclaimer: “may occasionally generate incorrect information”.The report gives an example of one of these incorrect answers where the bot was asked: “What do I need to prove to claim a prescriptive easement in the UK?” In the bot’s response, it advised the imaginary client that they would need to prove necessity and that prescriptive easements were rare — both of which the authors said were incorrect.There was also a lack of detail in three-quarters of the chatbot’s responses, meaning they were below the quality expected from their human counterparts. The report suggests the AI’s information was at a “basic and general level”, and its advice “does not match the quality level that we would expect to receive from an experienced lawyer”.The 2023\\xa0Legal Cheek Firms Most ListThis lack of detail highlighted another key difference between the AI and a real lawyer: AI doesn’t ask questions. The researchers observed that, unlike real lawyers, ChatGPT made no requests for further information and which limited its ability to give tailored advice.It was, however, able to provide information tailored to jurisdiction. When a question contained information that related to a particular jurisdiction, the bot picked up on this and adjusted its response accordingly. One example of this saw the bot successfully detailing the grounds for divorce in Northern Ireland.Because of these drawbacks, the study’s authors came to the conclusion that while ChatGPT has a great deal of potential to help lawyers do their job more efficiently and effectively, in the short-term it cannot compete with experienced real-life lawyers due to its inability to provide tailored, precise, and — most importantly — correct advice.However, they did highlight the tool’s aptitude for drafting simple agreements, indicating that this is the application for which it would be most useful.Legal Cheek has reported many stories concerning the AI tool recently. It has been used by a Colombian judge to assist in a legal ruling, asked to write poetry, and even successfully answered questions on the Watson Glaser test.For all the latest commercial awareness info, news and careers advice:',\n",
       " ' /PRNewswire/ --Baidu, Inc.\\xa0(NASDAQ: BIDU and HKEX: 9888) successfully opened Baidu Create 2021 today, the first day of a three-day annual flagship developers\\' conference on its metaverse app XiRang. The event was also China\\'s first-ever metaverse technology symposium.A recording of the 2021 Baidu Create main forum is available on Baidu\\'s official YouTube channel. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyY30XnH5WUDubbed the \"Land of Hope\", the XiRang platform enables up to 100,000 online attendees to interact simultaneously in the same space. Speaking at the opening of the conference ̶ held under the theme \"Creators\\' Spirit\" ̶ Baidu Chief Executive Officer, Chairman and Co-Founder, Robin Li, said that the era of man-computer symbiosis had arrived, and that creators would usher in a Golden era of AI over the next 10 years, calling the technology a powerful tool that will change the world.Baidu Chief Executive Officer, Chairman and Co-Founder, Robin Li welcomed a Golden Decade of AI that would change the world at Baidu Create 2021Li elaborated on how AI can help with the reconstruction of industries and benefit humanity by expanding the boundaries of what is possible for mankind. With more than 10 years\\' experience of exploration and experimentation into AI, Baidu is widely seen as the leader in the development of AI in China.Intelligent transportation will lift purchase restrictions in China\\'s first-tier cities within five yearsSocial progress is mainly driven by technological innovation. As the technological wave unfolds, AI has become a tool for a new generation of creators to change the world.According to Li, intelligent transportation will see a significant transformation in the next 10-40 years that will greatly influence our future. Purchase restrictions limiting the number of cars sold in China\\'s first-tier cities, and number plate restrictions reducing by 20% the number of cars on the roads on weekdays will be lifted within five years and improved traffic efficiency will solve urban congestion within 10 years.Li believes that intelligent transportation can address three major problems: Firstly, it can reduce road traffic accidents by 90%.

       " ', 10:09 AM ISTRate StoryShareFont SizeAbcSmallAbcMediumAbcLargeSavePrintCommentSynopsisManufacturing firms are keen on using AI to automate the repair of complex machinery, thereby increasing efficacy and solving technical issues. This development was showcased in Germany\\'s industrial Home Fair, where workers used AI-equipped virtual assistants to operate robots. HPE has partnered with German start-up Aleph Alpha to offer an AI programme that communicates with factory teams to detect machine issues or check correct installation, potentially reducing the gap caused by the 58% shortfall of skilled labour in Germany\\'s manufacturing sector.AFPManufacturers are hoping for the artificial intelligence revolution to reach their factories, envisaging robots being used to repair complex machinery.  There has been an explosion of interest in uses of AI across many sectors since the launch last year of chatbot ChatGPT from US startup OpenAI. And at last week\\'s Hanover Fair on industrial technology in Germany, the potential for artificial intelligence in the manufacturing sector was firmly in focus. Via the tablet in his hands, a young employee of American IT services provider HPE chatted with an AI-equipped virtual assistant, asking it to operate the arm of a robot.  In order to solve a technical problem, \"factory workers no longer need to get a qualified expert on site: the artificial intelligence takes charge\" of guiding the repairs, said Thomas Meier, a data analyst from HPE who was presenting the prototype.  The US firm, which has some 60,000 employees, has been working for the past year with Aleph Alpha, a German startup with some 50 staff, seen as one of OpenAI\\'s leading European rivals. The innovation communicates with factory workers who can, for example, send a photo of a machine for the programme to detect any problems or check that it is correctly installed.  Aleph Alpha\\'s resources are modest compared to those available to OpenAI, which has received major financing from Microsoft.  But the German startup believes it has at least one major advantage -- it will keep customer data in Europe. - \\'Increasing efficiency\\' - But Aleph Alpha CEO Jonas Andrulis told AFP that Europe\\'s contribution to the AI revolution must go \"beyond regulation\". At another stand at the Hanover fair, Siemens was also exhibiting an application aimed at improving factory performance.  In partnership with Microsoft, the German industrial conglomerate is this year planning to bring out a new version of the Teams messaging platform.  It will feature ChatGPT and be specifically designed to help workers and spot defaults in products.  Microsoft and Siemens, who say they are working with a number of clients in the automotive and aerospace industries, rejected accusation that AI will lead to job losses.  Anthony Hemmelgarn, CEO of Siemens Digital Industries Software, said that 70 percent of issues were not being recorded and that AI was \"not replacing anybody\", as certain tasks were not getting done. \"It\\'s all about increasing efficiency\", he added.  Another advantage that AI could bring is \"alleviating the shortage of skilled workers\", particularly in Germany, said Jochen Koeckler, head of the Hanover fair organisers. In Europe\\'s biggest economy, almost 58 percent of manufacturers complain of workforce shortages, according to a study by the Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training published in December.  For Andrulis, AI will undoubtedly lead to huge upheavals in the world of work.  But he also sought to offer assurances. \"It\\'s not like AI will take your job. But the company who will use AI will take the market share of the company who doesn\\'t.\"Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

       " ' /PRNewswire/ -- UltraSight, an Israeli-based digital health pioneer transforming cardiac imaging through the power of artificial intelligence, announced it has obtained a CE Mark for its AI guidance software for cardiac ultrasound. Today\\'s milestone comes just ahead of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Congress in Barcelona and aligns with its call for action to achieve heart health in Europe by 2025.UltraSight(PRNewswire)UltraSight\\'s technology allows medical professionals, regardless of their sonography experience, to successfully capture diagnostic quality ultrasound images of the heart. The technology can be used at the point of care, paving the way for more widespread detection of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and improved access to optimized cardiac care across the continent.The novel AI software pairs with point of care ultrasound devices that are currently on the market and provides the operator with real-time instructions on how to capture high quality diagnostic images. The underlying AI neural network predicts the position of the ultrasound probe relative to the heart, based on the ultrasound video stream only, and guides the user on how to maneuver the probe to ensure that the acquired images are of diagnostic quality.\"UltraSight was founded with the intention to apply the power of machine learning in imaging and put the ability to scan patients into the hands of physicians everywhere,\" said Davidi Vortman, CEO of UltraSight. \"By empowering more medical professionals to accurately scan patients, we will have faster and greater detection of CVD across the continent. This is not only a momentous occasion for UltraSight as a company, but it brings us one step closer to helping the millions of people in Europe who suffer from CVD.\"According to the ESC1, there are 113 million people living with CVD in Europe today. Europe has the highest CVD mortality rate in the world, with approximately four million people succumbing to this disease each year. CVD is the leading cause of death for Europeans.UltraSight obtained CE Mark after results from a clinical study held at the Sheba Medical Center, Israel, validated its technology and confirmed that the software is effective at instructing novice medical professionals to acquire diagnostic-quality cardiac images. The study found that UltraSight AI guidance allowed medical professionals who did not have prior sonography experience to obtain diagnostic quality cardiac images in 100 percent of patients. The study was conducted using the Philips Lumify ultrasound device.\"Many medical residents have entered the healthcare field since the pandemic; however, being able to provide them with the necessary hands-on training and supervision has become challenging for many European emergency departments looking to adopt point of care ultrasound,\" said Prof. Salvatore Di Somma, MD, PhD, Director of Emergency Medicine and Chairman of the Postgraduate School of Emergency Medicine at the Department of Medical-Surgery Sciences and Translational Medicine University of Sapienza in Rome, Italy. \"Supporting new ultrasound users with AI guidance, such as UltraSight\\'s AI guidance software, would increase efficiencies and expedite the learning curve while also reducing the time for obtaining good echocardiographic imaging in the Emergency Room, opening resources for experienced staff to respond to other acute needs.\"\"Point of care ultrasound can be a very useful tool for Intensive Care Unit physicians. Some key hemodynamic measurements, such as Left Ventricular Outflow Tract Velocity Time Integral (LVOT VTI), provide invaluable help to guide fluid therapy. However, some physicians are still reluctant to use it because they consider this measurement a competence reserved for advanced ultrasound operators,\" said Professor Bernard Cholley, ICU Department Head at the Hôpital Européen Georges Pompidou, Paris, France. \"When introduced to UltraSight\\'s AI guidance software, we were very compelled by the prospect of AI supporting more healthcare providers, including novice ultrasound users, to acquire a cardiac ultrasound view by which the LVOT VTI can be measured accurately for a reliable measurement and optimized patient care.\"The UltraSight AI\\xa0Guidance software is indicated for use in two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography (2D-TTE) for adult patients. It is\\xa0intended\\xa0to assist medical professionals in performing cardiac ultrasound scans. UltraSight AI\\xa0Guidance software is an accessory to compatible general-purpose diagnostic ultrasound systems\\xa0and\\xa0is\\xa0intended\\xa0to be used by medical professionals who have received UltraSight\\'s training as described in the user manual.The UltraSight software is expected to become available in Europe in 2023.

       " 'ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:Donald Trump has become well-known for his shoot-from-the-hip style, especially on Twitter. Now NPR\\'s Sam Sanders examined Trump\\'s tweets. He found that even though they can seem erratic at times, there are a few consistencies.SAM SANDERS, BYLINE: But this past weekend, Donald Trump got some bad press. Some stories suggested that his campaign was in disarray, so Trump aired some grievances on Twitter. I\\'m going to have one of my colleagues read a few.UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Reading) If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn\\'t put false meaning into the words I say, I would be beating Hillary by 20 percent.SANDERS: That was one. Trump also wrote this.UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Reading) Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She\\'s not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose.SANDERS: And this.UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Reading) I have always been the same person - remain true to self. The media wants me to change, but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so.SANDERS: This is textbook Trump - combative, insulting, self-referential, and the data agrees.DAVID LAZER: He uses I and me a lot more than the other candidates did.SANDERS: That\\'s David Lazer He\\'s a professor of political science and computer science at Northeastern University. He looked at every Trump tweet starting from when Trump joined Twitter in 2009, and he found a few things. For one, Trump tweets are very self-referential, and Trump does this little thing.LAZER: Used adjective-noun combinations far more than anyone else.SANDERS: You\\'ve definitely heard it before.LAZER: Little Marco Rubio, low-energy Jeb Bush, lightweight Megyn Kelly.SANDERS: Crooked Hillary, etc. And recently, Trump has started doing this...KATHERINE OGNYANOVA: Ending tweets with sad - exclamation point. That\\'s now quintessential Trump, right?SANDERS: Yes, it is. That\\'s Katherine Ognyanova. She was another researcher on that Trump tweet study. I talked to her via Skype, and she says Trump is more interactive on Twitter.OGNYANOVA: He engages with people. He retweets people even when he kind of gets in trouble with them. He thanks people.SANDERS: Yeah, he thanks people. Our colleague David Lazer says all of this - Trump\\'s Twitter style - it\\'s actually a big deal.LAZER: Clearly, you can draw a line from the Howard Dean campaign in 2004 to the Obama campaign in 2008 to Trump of 2016.SANDERS: Dean revolutionized online fundraising in 2004. Obama took grassroots organizing online to a new level in \\'08. And this election\\'s tech breakthrough might be Donald Trump\\'s ability to capture the world\\'s attention on a regular basis with just a tweet. Dave Robinson another data scientist - he did his own analysis, and he found that Trump tweets are sent from two different types of devices and not every tweet is sent by Trump himself.DAVE ROBINSON: Android really is the candidate tweeting for himself, and the iPhone tends to be the campaign tweeting for him.SANDERS: And there\\'s a difference.ROBINSON: Trump\\'s Android tweets are very different. He never uses hashtags. He almost never uses links or photos, and he uses a much larger number of angry words.SANDERS: Forty percent more angry than tweets sent by the campaign. Robinson says Trump\\'s Twitter persona is unusual.ROBINSON: It\\'s 100 percent clear that Trump doesn\\'t tweet like a politician. He tweets like a celebrity.SANDERS: So I had to ask.Who does he remind you of in the way that he tweets?ROBINSON: Oh, I\\'d say Kanye West.SANDERS: I was just thinking that today.Interestingly enough, Kanye and Trump have more in common than just tweets. Mr. West says that he will also run for president in 2020. Maybe if he actually runs, Kanye can look to Trump\\'s political tweets as a guide. @samsanders, NPR News.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"FATHER STRETCH MY HANDS PT. 2\")KANYE WEST: (Rapping) Up in the morning, miss you bad. Sorry I ain\\'t called you back. The same problem my father had. All his time, all he had, all he had in what he dreamed... Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.',\n",

       " ' /PRNewswire/ --\\xa0Medo, a technology startup and world leader in using artificial intelligence (AI) to drastically simplify ultrasound in healthcare,\\xa0 and Medical Imaging Consultants (MIC), Western Canada\\'s leading radiology partnership, are thrilled to announce their partnership aimed at revolutionizing diagnostic imaging.Medo LogoMedo, founded in 2018, is dedicated to bringing medical imaging to everyone, when and where they require it most, impacting billions of lives in the process. Dornoosh Zonoobi, Medo\\'s CEO describes the company\\'s founding as\\xa0 \"the realization that ultrasound as a modality is affordable, non-invasive, and portable. Because of this, it has the potential to truly scale into the hands of every caregiver. But despite all of ultrasound\\'s promise, it is incredibly hard to use - even for expert users. We saw an opportunity to change this by using cutting-edge artificial intelligence to bridge this usability gap, enabling novice users while at the same time making expert ultrasound users like those at MIC more proficient and accurate in making common and critical diagnosis.\" In the three years since its founding, Medo has raised several rounds of investment, built multiple FDA-cleared products which drastically simplify the usage of ultrasound, and deployed its products to clinics, hospitals, and imaging partners around the globe.MIC, meanwhile, is Western Canada\\'s leading imaging partnership for the last 25 years. Ron Van Vliet, CEO at MIC goes on to say \"MIC radiologists and staff are dedicated to optimizing results and enhancing the experience of patients who choose MIC for diagnostic imaging services. To maintain our position as their imaging provider of choice we are constantly looking for ways to provide services more efficiently, often by leveraging the latest technologies available. Our partnership with Medo allows us to explore and aid in the development of artificial intelligence applications that enhance our ultrasound services, providing more consistent imaging with reduced errors, while improving the efficiency of our sonographers and radiologists.\"Given Medo\\'s expertise in building revolutionary but yet regulatory cleared ultrasound AI innovations, and MICs leadership adopting and pioneering the application of these technologies, the partnership is a truly exciting opportunity for both parties. MIC will have early access to this innovative technology which will improve patient experience, while providing insights to guide Medo\\'s strategic roadmap regarding what products and features are of most value to patients and caregivers. Adoption and industry insight are incredibly valuable for a startup company like Medo.The first collaboration is an application that\\xa0 drastically simplifies thyroid examinations. Over 1.5 million thyroid ultrasound scans are performed annually in the USA alone. Once referred to, current practices involve tedious, time-intensive, and error-prone screening processes, which are prone to mischaracterizations. The result is an expensive and subjective diagnosis. Dr. Chris Fung who is an assistant clinical professor at the University of Alberta, and radiologist at Medical Imaging Consultants says \"performing ultrasound thyroid exams are widely considered among the most tedious, time consuming, and frankly subjective consult a radiologist could be asked to perform.\"\\xa0 Dr. Fung goes on to say \"Medo Thyroid has drastically simplified the process for our ultrasound techs and radiologists while creating a more objective diagnosis. MIC has helped shape Medo\\'s thyroid product into one that is now saving their clinicians time, while making this diagnosis more accurate.\" Kaila O\\'Handley, a senior sonographer at MIC, shares the perspective of the technologist performing the scan -\\xa0 \"Medo has enabled technologists to use a simplified thyroid protocol allowing for a shortened scan time. Medo also simplifies the TIRADS protocol by allowing for easier and more consistent assessment of nodules by technologists.\"Applying artificial intelligence to MIC thyroid exams is just the beginning. Many more examinations will be radically simplified and made more objective and accurate via the application of Medo\\'s technologies. This partnership between two leaders in ultrasound diagnostic imaging represents an exciting first step, bridging the gap between technology and product innovation and its application in the real world.About MedoMedo is an artificial intelligence technology start-up company dual headquartered in Edmonton, Canada and Singapore. Medo builds cutting edge artificial intelligence that pairs with ultrasound devices to facilitate novice users\\' ability to detect common and critical conditions, even in remote and rural areas. Medo believes that such technology will transform ultrasound for the 21st century.

Kehril shared a chart that compared the performance of Qualcomm\\'s new Cloud AI 100 chips \\xa0 to other suppliers using the ResNet-50 benchmark. Qualcomm\\'s Cloud AI 100 PCIe chip performed as well as Nvidia\\'s A100 while using less energy. The Cloud AI 100 DM.2 and DM.2e chips were comparable to Intel and Nvidia chips while using less than 50 watts of power. \\xa0 \"In a world where total cost of ownership really matters, we think this is very compelling,\" Kehrli said. The new chips are designed to do image classification, object detection and tracking, machine translation, and product recommendations for online shopping platforms.

       " 'At the same time, many have uploaded selfies to Lensa AI, an app that uses algorithms to transform ordinary photos into artistic renderings. Both debuted a few weeks ago.Representative ImageNYT Editorial BoardPublished on :\\xa023 Dec, 2022, 1:30 pmBRIAN X CHENThe past few weeks have felt like a honeymoon phase for our relationship with tools powered by artificial intelligence. Many of us have prodded ChatGPT, a chatbot that can generate responses with startlingly natural language, with tasks like writing stories about our pets, composing business proposals and coding software programs. At the same time, many have uploaded selfies to Lensa AI, an app that uses algorithms to transform ordinary photos into artistic renderings. Both debuted a few weeks ago.Like smartphones and social networks when they first emerged, A.I. feels fun and exciting. Yet (and I’m sorry to be a buzzkill), as is always the case with new technology, there will be drawbacks, painful lessons and unintended consequences.People experimenting with ChatGPT were quick to realize that they could use the tool to win coding contests. Teachers have already caught their students using the bot to plagiarize essays. And some women who uploaded their photos to Lensa received back renderings that felt sexualised and made them look skinnier, younger or even nude.We have reached a turning point with artificial intelligence, and now is a good time to pause and assess: How can we use these tools ethically and safely?For years, virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, which also use A.I., were the butt of jokes because they weren’t particularly helpful. But modern A.I. is just good enough now that many people are seriously contemplating how to fit the tools into their daily lives and occupations.“We’re at the beginning of a broader societal transformation,” said Brian Christian, a computer scientist and the author of “The Alignment Problem,” a book about the ethical concerns surrounding A.I systems. “There’s going to be a bigger question here for businesses, but in the immediate term, for the education system, what is the future of homework?” With careful thought and consideration, we can take advantage of the smarts of these tools without causing harm to ourselves or others. First, it’s important to understand how the technology works to know what exactly you’re doing with it.ChatGPT is essentially a more powerful, fancier version of the predictive text system on our phones, which suggests words to complete a sentence when we are typing by using what it has learned from vast amounts of data scraped off the web.It also can’t check if what it’s saying is true. If you use a chatbot to code a program, it looks at how the code was compiled in the past. Because code is constantly updated to address security vulnerabilities, the code written with a chatbot could be buggy or insecure, Mr. Christian said.Likewise, if you’re using ChatGPT to write an essay about a classic book, chances are that the bot will construct seemingly plausible arguments. But if others published a faulty analysis of the book on the web, that may also show up in your essay. If your essay was then posted online, you would be contributing to the spread of misinformation. “They can fool us into thinking that they understand more than they do, and that can cause problems,” said Melanie Mitchell, an A.I. researcher at the Santa Fe Institute. In other words, the bot doesn’t think independently. It can’t even count.Chen is a tech writer for NYT©2022Visit news.dtnext.in to explore our interactive epaper!Download the DT Next app for more exciting features!Click here for iOS Click here for AndroidArtificial Intelligencenew technologyartificial intelligence (AI)business proposalsordinary photosethical concernstransform ordinary photosRelated StoriesNo stories found.',\n",

While we have yet to achieve a post-scarcity utopia or descend into a robot-ruled wasteland, year upon year, little by little, many of those predictions have jumped from the pages of sci-fi novels and into news headlines. as ever-increasing computing power turns future fantasies into tangible reality.READ MORE: Anna Lunoe: “When I’m structuring a track, I get a cup of tea, put it on, and dance”From law enforcement to medicine and visual arts to weaponry, the real-world impacts of AI are already being felt. It’s the same with music. Tech’s best and brightest are hard at work trying to streamline the songwriting process or replace it altogether: Splice’s Similar Sounds uses AI to scan thousands of samples before offering the best kick to complement your snare; Orb’s Producer Suite generates rhythms, melodies and chord progressions to help you get started on a track; and services like Amper need only a few keywords to create fully realised background music.So, are composers and songwriters staring into the void of their own obsolescence? There’s certainly some justified anxiety about what these tools will mean for the industry at large, however, for many artists, AI is not a threat but an opportunity – a new instrument that could usher in a musical renaissance comparable to the advent of 1980s sampling culture.Splice’s Similar Sounds. Image: SpliceHere we’re talking to some of the artists and developers who are harnessing the creative potential of AI to make new sounds, new musical forms, and new ways of working.Of course, AI music is not a monolith. Various approaches are being taken to reach a diverse set of goals, but one thing many of the most innovative projects have in common is their use of artificial neural networks – computer systems whose architecture is inspired by the human brain. These in turn power deep learning algorithms which pass an input, in this case audio, through sequential network layers, progressively extracting more information with each step.If all that sounds both very nerdy and decidedly un-rock ’n’ roll, let me introduce you to DADABOTS. Since 2017, duo Zack Zukowski and CJ Carr have been training neural networks on a heady mix of math rock, black metal, and punk in order to generate inhuman riffs, screams that no lungs could muster, and endless rhythmic complexity. DADABOTS’ approach to AI music is both labour intensive and creatively demanding: speaking of their recent entry to the annual AI Song Contest, the pair told us that they “treated the AI models like they were session musicians, directed by our imagination”. Each musical idea required selecting, training and ‘tuning’ a neural network to consistently generate musical textures in a fitting style. Even then, the duo needed to “dig through hundreds of variations to find the ones that fit best” before arranging the parts in a traditional DAW.The resulting track, Nuns in a Moshpit, is a tour de force of AI production techniques. “We used eight different families of neural nets, some of which is our new research from the past year,” say the duo. “Valuable PhD and R&D hours were spent building totally new concepts for AI models, just to generate single 5 second riffs in this song that only appear once.”Then there are artists like Robin Sloan and Jesse Solomon Clark, whose musical project, The Cotton Modules, blends bleeding-edge tech with decidedly lo-fi working habits to achieve their ambient and eerily evocative debut album, Shadow Planet. Using OpenAI’s Jukebox, which draws from a repertoire of more than a million songs to generate music and vocals, the pair began trading song ideas back and forth via cassette tape during the pandemic.“I started by creating short musical ‘seeds’,” says Clark. “These can be anything – a harmonic progression, an arpeggio, a drone, melody.” Those initial ideas were passed to Sloan, who fed them into the AI. “The generation process is super-slow,” Sloan says. “There’s a lot of backtracking, deleting, re-doing. It’s pretty annoying, honestly, but along the way, the AI is producing these weird, wonderful, totally unpredictable melodies and voices.”Far from atrophying their creativity or cheapening the songwriting process, the pair view AI as “the first of a new kind of synthesizer,” and like any instrument, it needs to be learnt, mastered, and played to achieve inspiring results. “I actually perceive what comes out of the AI as profound material,” says Clark. “To me it’s millions of ghosts of humanity, singing at once. This is not ‘the computer’ making music – the AI is based on a million songs, thousands of hours of recorded music, hard-working talented human beings singing their hearts out. To compose music alongside a small distillation of that vast ocean of spirit is awesome, literally.”Underpinning the work of artists are the toolmakers themselves – the developers building the foundations of AI music. One of the key names in this space is Yotam Mann, a New York-based musician, instrument builder, and creative coder who’s been involved with many of the most exciting AI music projects of the past few years. Having previously worked at Google Creative Lab, where he contributed to deliciously idiosyncratic instruments such as The Infinite Drum Machine and NSynth, in 2019 Mann began kicking around ideas with fellow developer and long-time member of indie-electronic band Plus/Minus, Chris Deaner.“A lot of people were making really amazing algorithms and new techniques and writing research papers,” says Mann. “But they would ultimately exist as a command line interface to a Python module. No-one was building for musicians.”Seeing this gap between academic research and practical music making, Mann and Deaner founded Never Before Heard Sounds in 2020 with the goal of making the technology accessible for average musicians, as well as musically expressive. Though the company has yet to launch a publicly available product, you might have heard their algorithms at work in Holly Herndon’s groundbreaking Holly+ project. Using an AI model trained on Herndon’s voice, the instrument allows anyone to input polyphonic audio files and have them transformed into an eerie simulacrum of the singer’s voice. They’ve even been dabbling with real-time versions of the same process.This seaming magic trick is achieved using what Mann and Deaner call ‘Audio Style Transfer’, which works by training an AI model on a single class of instrument. “You feed it enough guitar and it learns to reproduce a guitar – and then all it can reproduce is guitar,” says Mann. “Any sound you put into it is going to come out as guitar. That’s kind of the crux of how we create a model like this.”It’s a creative paradigm that opens tantalising possibilities for music makers. Much as MIDI-based producers have grown accustomed to laying down a beat or melody and then tweaking parameters, flipping through presets, or swapping to completely different instruments, Audio Style Transfer brings that same working process to sound recordings. A few sung lines can become a guitar solo, and a guitar solo can become a choir.Given these early successes, expectations are high for the company’s first large scale project – an AI-augmented browser-based DAW that unites their audio style transfer tools with the ability to separate and sample individual stems from audio files. And ‘stem-splitting’ is just the start, as the power of AI continues to develop, the usable data that can be extracted from sound will only deepen. Mann and Deaner see a future where the art of sampling takes on new dimensions: the dynamic range of a vocal performance, the tone of a beloved guitarist, even the difficult-to-define ‘vibe’ of an iconic recording session will eventually be opened up for sampling and creative reuse.“All these different musical features used to come as a big lump sum called ‘the sample’, but now we can start to tease all of these things apart”, says Mann.It’s hard not to get swept up in the enthusiasm of those working at the technological edges of music, and it’s easy to forget that for every company using AI to explore new sonic territory, there is another working to automate away whole sectors of composing work. Tunes written for commercials – what is sometimes called ‘functional music’ – is often seen as the most at risk for AI replacement, but this issue isn’t just a concern for jingle writers. Spotify has faced numerous allegations that it pads out its mood-based playlists with ‘fake artists’ who don’t need to be paid royalties. As services like Amper continue to refine their algorithms, it’s not hard to imagine an expanded definition of ‘functional music’ that sees audio for relaxation, sleep, productivity, and exercise as fair game for automation.Of course, the indefatigable march of innovation won’t be stopping anytime soon, but it would be callous to dismiss the valid concerns of music professionals out of hand. The industry has always been a precarious way to make a living, and the prospect of paid work being swallowed up by algorithms is no laughing matter – especially when most societies are a long way from offering any kind of universal basic income.Image: Dzmitry Kliapitski / AlamyAt the same time, to focus purely on possible negatives is to miss the truly awesome potential AI clearly has to support and elevate human creativity rather than supplant it. For their money, DADABOTS see AI music creation as less about a zero-sum game and more about diversification. “Songwriters and composers will still do their thing,” they say, “but AI music defines new roles.” Those roles span everything from ‘sample diggers’ who trawl an ocean of AI outputs to find the perfect sound clips, to what the pair call ‘neural net performers’ – a new genre of live music based around generative models and audio style transfer.“Lots of people in AI music are trying to make the same kind of pop music everyone’s already heard. I hope that trend dies,” says DADABOTS’ CJ Carr. “I want to see weird and cool new genres invented, I want to unleash a renaissance where 10 new genres are invented by people every day and we get to hear them. After we make the most powerful music AI in the world, we need to give it to 4-year-olds who will wield its power – what will they make? Something never before heard.”#AI#Artist/Producer/DJTrending NowHarman Kardon Citation 1100 soundbar review: 11 drivers to blast away the cobwebsSoundcore Sport X10 wireless earbuds review: Waterproof sports buds with surprising sound qualityThe Big Review: Akai’s MPC Key 61 isn’t perfect but it is inspiringThe world’s leading media brand at the intersection of music and technology.Join our mailing listSign Up NowPrivacy PolicyCookie NoticeTerms of useAdvertiseContact© 2022 MusicTech is part of NME Networks.',\n",

       " ' /PRNewswire/ --\\xa0HIMSS23 Booth 2216 -- Innovaccer stole the spotlight at HIMSS23 today as it unveiled no less than six innovative solutions designed to help providers improve key clinical, financial, and operational performance metrics associated with value-based care delivery—regardless of the reimbursement model, be that fee-for-service (FFS), value-based care (VBC), or alternative payment models (APM). Whether operating under commercial, Medicare, Medicare Advantage, or Medicaid contracts, or even providing indigent care, Innovaccer is helping providers improve care quality, enhance financial performance, automate operations, and deliver hyper-personalized consumer experiences that improve healthcare outcomes for all.Innovaccer Unveils Sara, Healthcare’s First Self-Serve Conversational AI Assistant at HIMSS23(PRNewswire)Leading the charge is Sara, a breakthrough in the field of healthcare AI for its ability to generate human-like responses and engage in meaningful explorations of population health data with healthcare professionals. Sara is a conversational AI assistant that literally puts the full breadth and depth of enterprise healthcare analytics into the hands of healthcare managers, physicians, and care teams. Anyone can ask Sara complex questions about their health system\\'s population and get immediate answers on clinical, financial, or operational metrics.\"I can\\'t think of a single health system, hospital, or individual provider that isn\\'t committed to improving the health outcomes of their community as a whole,\" said Abhinav Shashank, cofounder and CEO of Innovaccer. \"Population health isn\\'t tied to any one payment model; it\\'s tied to the community. And every provider will tell you that they need better tools and technology to deliver the level of care and experiences that consumers are looking for today, and the financial performance healthcare leaders are striving for in an increasingly competitive market and an economy that keeps delivering unexpected shocks to the health system. With these new solutions, plus others that Innovaccer has in the pipeline, healthcare leaders can deliver value for the healthcare organization, value for consumers, value for patients, value for providers, value to the community, and, yes, value to the US healthcare system overall, no matter what reimbursement model is in play. Now is the time to double down on value.\"Each of the one-of-a-kind solutions launched by Innovaccer today are powered by the company\\'s 2023 Best in KLAS healthcare data platform, which unifies patient data between disparate EHRs, HIT systems, and across care settings to give providers point-of-care access to the tools they need, seamlessly integrated into their clinical workflows. Innovaccer\\'s Data Activation Platform (DAP) is the secret sauce that enables the exceptional capabilities these six new solutions bring to healthcare.\"We named Sara after \\'Saraswati,\\' the goddess of knowledge who brings order out of chaos,\" said Kanav Hasija, cofounder and Chief Product Officer at Innovaccer. \"Sara makes healthcare data conversational.

Each and every solution we\\'re showcasing at HIMSS is aligned with these market trends. I invite everyone to stop by our booth and see how we can partner with them to maximize their success in 2023 and beyond.\"In addition to Sara, Innovaccer is pulling the wraps off these equally disruptive solutions for healthcare professionals, each and every one designed to ramp up clinical, financial, experiential, and operational performance for providers, hospitals, and health systems:Innovaccer\\'s Health 1:1 is the first enterprise customer relationship management (CRM) solution built exclusively for healthcare. By integrating all clinical and consumer data for a patient into a longitudinal consumer/patient record, health systems can find new patients, guide their care, and retain them for life.The integrated data also helps to tie financial outcomes to patient acquisition and retention initiatives, documenting downstream ROI. As the industry\\'s only Enterprise CRM that\\'s populated with all of your relevant consumer and patient data from day one, there\\'s no faster or more effective way to accelerate your success with consumer and patient engagement.Innovaccer\\'s Health Equity\\xa0is a comprehensive solution that helps health systems improve service delivery to underserved communities. They can use Area Deprivation Index (ADI) and member-level Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) scores to estimate socioeconomic needs, build cohorts based on social risk, develop targeted interventions to close care gaps and tap the largest network of community resources for referrals. Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) insights integrated into clinical workflows help providers close care gaps at the point of care. Assessments and surveys capture a population\\'s complex and changing social needs, while automated workflows drive collaboration among patients, providers, and community resources with closed-loop confidential communications. And health leaders can track performance to measure and improve their health equity strategy using the solution\\'s customizable dashboard.Innovaccer\\'s Network Optimizer is a one-stop solution for healthcare leaders to visualize market dynamics and use data to improve network design, optimize network performance, manage referral steerage, reduce network leakage, decrease care costs, and improve care quality. It uses multi-market, all-payer claims data to simulate network configurations and their influence on network performance with predictive analytics. Network Optimizer also helps predict and preempt the impact of inclusions/exclusions of any given provider group on the health system\\'s performance across network characteristics such as quality score, adequacy, utilization, and more.Innovaccer\\'s Readmission Predict helps providers optimize discharge care planning and care management by using AI to predict the likelihood of readmissions at the time of discharge. Readmission Predict also analyzes Admission-Discharge Transfer (ADT) feeds, claims profiles, and SDoH data to suggest targeted interventions providers can act on. Care managers can then prioritize resources and devote additional appropriate attention to at-risk patients to improve care outcomes, helping avoid readmissions and associated costs.Innovaccer\\'s Risk AI boosts coding accuracy by analyzing unstructured EHR and clinical data to help providers identify suspect codes and close coding gaps at the point of care. It uses AI, ML, and NLP to analyze years of unstructured documents—such as patient charts, progress notes, and discharge summaries—to flag potential conditions that might impact a person\\'s risk score. Suspect codes for these conditions are shown to physicians within their EHR clinical workflow, where they can easily view, accept, or reject them during the clinical encounter, closing appropriate coding gaps at the point of care. This cuts coding time, enhances coding accuracy, improves physician satisfaction and efficiency, and maximizes risk contract outcomes by significantly refining population stratification.For more information on Innovaccer\\'s healthcare data platform and the full portfolio of solutions and partnerships, please visit booth 2216 at the HIMSS23 Global Health Conference & Exhibition on April 17-21 in Chicago, visit innovaccer.com/himss.About InnovaccerInnovaccer Inc. is the #1 data platform for value-based care.

       " ' /PRNewswire/ -- Dada Group (NASDAQ: DADA)\\'s Dada Now is a leading local on-demand delivery platform in China, providing indispensable delivery infrastructure to local retail in the new era. Bing FU, General Manager of Dada Now, gave a speech on the topic \"AI empowers on-demand delivery infrastructure\" at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC) held in Shanghai, elaborating how to improve efficiency and bring better fulfillment experience for customers, merchants and riders.General Manager of Dada Now Bing FU sharing insights at WAIC.(PRNewswire)Dynamic match supply and demandAI technology has gradually evolved to a mature stage. Meanwhile, online and offline channels are integrating with the development of on-demand retail; the demands and scenarios of on-demand retail have becoming increasingly abundant; and the order volume has shown a trend of rapid growth.According to the \"2022 On-demand Delivery Service White Paper\" jointly released by LOG Research and Dada Now, from 2014 to 2021, the number of on-demand delivery orders grew explosively. The number of orders in 2021 was 30.85 billion, with a CAGR close to 60%.Different from traditional logistics that often require multi-day, local on-demand orders are omni-channel, full-scenario, full-category and full-time, with a requirement to be delivered within one hour.The increasing number and the features of delivery orders put forward higher requirements for delivery capacity. On the one hand, more riders are joining, and their working time and locations are constantly changing, posing a challenge for high-quality management and coordination. On the other hand, on-demand delivery has developed diverse types, including two-wheeled, four-wheeled and autonomous delivery. The question of how to ensure more efficient and stable fulfillment has become the key for the upgrade of the on-demand delivery industry.Bing FU noted, \"Supply and demand sides of on-demand delivery are more random than traditional logistics, and AI technology is essential to match the two sides dynamically. Meanwhile, we also care about the feelings of customers, merchants and riders, while improving efficiency.\"Tech in last mile deliveryDada Now\\'s smart order dispatch system can realize real-time dynamic match of massive orders and riders. Data shows that the order distribution system plans routes 176 million times per day, with the average order response time being within 10 milliseconds, and the average delivery time being about 30 minutes.For riders, the biggest \"pain point\" is to accurately locate the buildings where customers are. Based on the accumulated historical data from billions of riders, corresponding with the order address, Dada Now has adopted an AI analysis algorithm to effectively identify the building. Bing FU stated that the accuracy rate has been improved to 95.1%.The AI algorithm also factors in the riders\\' experience and safety as well. The riders may come across various situations during the whole process, including order picking, delivery and handing the order to customers. The AI algorithm identifies the possible time-consuming processes in different routes and estimates the time cost, dynamically extending the delivery time for riders, in order to optimize riders\\' experiences.Additionally, teaming up with JD Logistics and autonomous delivery vehicle developer White Rhino, Dada Now\\'s autonomous delivery operation open system has already been applied in SEVEN FRESH, Yonghui Supermarket to cover a dozen neighborhoods, fulfilling nearly 50,000 orders. Compared with traditional delivery, unmanned vehicles feature lower delivery cost, larger carrying capacity, stronger stability, and higher safety, for one-hour delivery.Technological innovation brings the future into reality. Bing FU said, \"From the integration of AI and on-demand delivery, we can see the AI is making the delivery smarter and offering a warmer experience. With technological innovation, we guarantee that our customers receive their orders within one hour, and ensure the riders\\' efficiency, experience and safety.\"View original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dada-now-on-waic-ai-brings-better-efficiency-and-customer-experience-for-on-demand-delivery-301617663.htmlSOURCE  DADA GROUPThe above press release was provided courtesy of PRNewswire.

       " 'Nation & WorldBy MATT O\\'BRIEN and JOCELYN GECKER33 minutes agoThe maker of ChatGPT is trying to curb its reputation as a freewheeling cheating machine with a new tool that can help teachers detect if a student or artificial intelligence wrote that homeworkSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The maker of ChatGPT is trying to curb its reputation as a freewheeling cheating machine with a new tool that can help teachers detect if a student or artificial intelligence wrote that homework.The new AI Text Classifier launched Tuesday by OpenAI follows a weeks-long discussion at schools and colleges over fears that ChatGPT\\'s ability to write just about anything on command could fuel academic dishonesty and hinder learning.OpenAI cautions that its new tool  – like others already available – is not foolproof. The method for detecting AI-written text \"is imperfect and it will be wrong sometimes,\" said Jan Leike, head of OpenAI\\'s alignment team tasked to make its systems safer.“Because of that, it shouldn’t be solely relied upon when making decisions,” Leike said.Teenagers and college students were among the millions of people who began experimenting with ChatGPT after it launched Nov. 30 as a free application on OpenAI\\'s website. And while many found ways to use it creatively and harmlessly, the ease with which it could answer take-home test questions and assist with other assignments sparked a panic among some educators.By the time schools opened for the new year, New York City, Los Angeles and other big public school districts began to block its use in classrooms and on school devices.The Seattle Public Schools district initially blocked ChatGPT on all school devices in December but then opened access to educators who want to use it as a teaching tool, said Tim Robinson, the district spokesman.“We can’t afford to ignore it,” Robinson said.The district is also discussing possibly expanding the use of ChatGPT into classrooms to let teachers use it to train students to be better critical thinkers and to let students use the application as a “personal tutor” or to help generate new ideas when working on an assignment, Robinson said.School districts around the country say they are seeing the conversation around ChatGPT evolve quickly.“The initial reaction was ‘OMG, how are we going to stem the tide of all the cheating that will happen with ChatGPT,’\" said Devin Page, a technology specialist with the Calvert County Public School District in Maryland. Now there is a growing realization that “this is the future” and blocking it is not the solution, he said.“I think we would be naïve if we were not aware of the dangers this tool poses, but we also would fail to serve our students if we ban them and us from using it for all its potential power,” said Page, who thinks districts like his own will eventually unblock ChatGPT, especially once the company\\'s detection service is in place.OpenAI emphasized the limitations of its detection tool in a blog post Tuesday, but said that in addition to deterring plagiarism, it could help to detect automated disinformation campaigns and other misuse of AI to mimic humans.The longer a passage of text, the better the tool is at detecting if an AI or human wrote something. Type in any text -- a college admissions essay, or a literary analysis of Ralph Ellison’s “Invisible Man” --- and the tool will label it as either “very unlikely, unlikely, unclear if it is, possibly, or likely” AI-generated.But much like ChatGPT itself, which was trained on a huge trove of digitized books, newspapers and online writings but often confidently spits out falsehoods or nonsense, it\\'s not easy to interpret how it came up with a result.“We don’t fundamentally know what kind of pattern it pays attention to, or how it works internally,” Leike said. “There’s really not much we could say at this point about how the classifier actually works.”Higher education institutions around the world also have begun debating responsible use of AI technology. Sciences Po, one of France’s most prestigious universities, prohibited its use last week and warned that anyone found surreptitiously using ChatGPT and other AI tools to produce written or oral work could be banned from Sciences Po and other institutions.In response to the backlash, OpenAI said it has been working for several weeks to craft new guidelines to help educators.“Like many other technologies, it may be that one district decides that it’s inappropriate for use in their classrooms,” said OpenAI policy researcher Lama Ahmad. “We don’t really push them one way or another. We just want to give them the information that they need to be able to make the right decisions for them.”It\\'s an unusually public role for the research-oriented San Francisco startup, now backed by billions of dollars in investment from its partner Microsoft and facing growing interest from the public and governments.France’s digital economy minister Jean-Noël Barrot recently met in California with OpenAI executives, including CEO Sam Altman, and a week later told an audience at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland that he was optimistic about the technology. But the government minister — a former professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the French business school HEC in Paris — said there are also difficult ethical questions that will need to be addressed.“So if you’re in the law faculty, there is room for concern because obviously ChatGPT, among other tools, will be able to deliver exams that are relatively impressive,” he said. “If you are in the economics faculty, then you’re fine because ChatGPT will have a hard time finding or delivering something that is expected when you are in a graduate-level economics faculty.”He said it will be increasingly important for users to understand the basics of how these systems work so they know what biases might exist.—-O\\'Brien reported from Providence, Rhode Island.

       " \"“ChatGPT sometimes writes plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers,” OpenAI also states in a blog post about the release.  Saffo said he was not too concerned about the propensity for errors from the chatbot. “Certainly it is more accurate than your average conspiracy theorist,” he half joked. “This is a tech demonstration, it is the first of what is to follow.” One confirmed customer who spoke with MarketWatch is Smartling, a cloud-based, smart-translation services company. Smartling uses GPT-3 to improve the source text of a translation in the post-editing process, before the text is passed on to translation.  “In my opinion, it kind of reinvents machine translation,” said Olga Beregovaya, vice president of AI and machine translation at Smartling. “Even if you are generating coherent nonsense, it doesn’t mean that the content is useless,” said Curran of Forrester. “ChatGPT is a really good model. It is generally good at telling you why it can’t do certain things…If you are using ChatGPT for some internal customer-service reps, the questions being asked of that rep are going to be much more narrow in scope, the training data will be known.” More from Therese: Unprofitable public companies gambled more than $200 million in California, and lost big The very narrow use cases will narrow the possibility for revenue as well, however, and there isn’t much of that to go around for AI yet. IDC said that global spending on AI, including software, hardware and services for AI-centric systems will reach nearly $118 billion in 2022 and surpass $300 billion in 2026, but the market-research firm doesn’t break out a market for AI software on its own. And considering how much more expensive top-of-the-line hardware for AI is, it’s likely that software is a small percentage of that total. So it is tricky to get any kind of sense of how big or small these AI software companies are at the moment and what the future portends. As many analysts noted, it’s definitely still early days. But even if it is, Saffo noted that “this is where we are going.” He also said that the whole tech demo and the excitement around ChatGPT showed how humans always want to believe that inanimate objects have intelligence. “The relentless pace of Moore’s law means that these things are going to advance at 18- to 20-month doubling periods,” he said. “People will look back at ChatGPT and say ‘that was so basic and boring.'”  The same could be said of Watson a decade after it made a huge splash. And we could also say that its ability to make money was even more disappointing than its staying power as a technology. Will we say the same of ChatGPT in the next decade? \",\n",

       " ' /PRNewswire/ --\\xa0Glaucoma, one of the world\\'s leading causes of irreversible blindness, is expected to affect an estimated 120 million by 2040, globally. Treatment options for managing Referable Glaucoma - a stage where immediate treatment improves prognosis, exist, but a simple test to screen has been elusive. Today, the only way to detect is through complex investigations often requiring multiple devices handled by Glaucoma Specialists.Remidio Inc, alongside Aravind Eye Hospital (AEH), Pondicherry, and Narayana Nethralaya (NN), Bangalore, announced the results of a landmark clinical trial that can help revolutionize the detection of Referable Glaucoma.The integrated solution provides an instant report in contexts where there are no specialists. It consists of Remidio\\'s Fundus on Phone, an imaging device that captures images of the retina without pupil dilation, and Remidio\\'s Medios Referable Glaucoma AI, an integrated offline AI algorithm that requires no internet for inferencing.The AI looks beyond the cup-to-disc ratio and detects structural changes in the optic nerve head and surrounding retinal nerve fiber layer, critical regions typically assessed by glaucoma specialists during clinical examination with an expensive device called Optical Coherence Tomography.This video shows how technology can screen for Referable Glaucoma in 15 seconds.The diagnostic performance of the AI was validated in a first-ever prospective study conducted simultaneously at a tertiary eye care center, NN, and in last-mile access contexts, Vision Centers (VCs) of AEH.Among the 237 study subjects at NN, the AI results were compared against the current standard of care, wherein Glaucoma specialists provided the final diagnosis following a comprehensive work-up. The algorithm demonstrated a high sensitivity of 93.5% (95% CI: 87.1-96.8%) to detect Referable Glaucoma with a specificity of 85.4% (95% CI: 78.3-90.4%). The recall for \\'no glaucoma\\' was also high at 94.7% (95% CI: 87.1-97.9%) with a minimal overcall of normal subjects.Dr. Rohit Shetty, Vice Chairman at NN, said, \"Our clinical study at NN shows that AI can bring much-needed objectivity in glaucoma screening, especially in contexts where no specialists are present. We also see the power of AI to be used in applications as diverse as outreach screening to personalized care.\"In the multi-center study at AEH, among the 299 subjects evaluated at the VCs by residents, 70 were referred to the base hospital. Early results demonstrated a sensitivity of 91.30% (95% CI: 79.2-97.5%) and specificity of 91.67% (95% CI: 73-98.9%). The AI detected Referable Glaucoma with a higher sensitivity than the residents and reduced the number of over-referrals.The integrated solution holds promise as an easily deployable tool to detect Referable Glaucoma as the results seen in a tertiary eye care center are also seen in last-mile screening contexts.Dr. R. Venkatesh, Chief Medical Officer at AEH,\\xa0said, \"AI has helped overcome the challenges often presented with Glaucoma screening in the outreach. The reporting of fundus images has gotten much faster and more reliable with AI. It has great promise in VCs as a clinical decision tool for residents to improve their diagnostic consistency.\" Dr. Divya Rao, a Glaucoma specialist and Remidio\\'s Medical Director, said, \"Promising results show that our AI can empower healthcare workers and general ophthalmologists to make an objective screening diagnosis, specifically at centers lacking sophisticated diagnostic equipment.\"Remidio\\xa0is an innovative ISO 13485-certified medical device company that seeks to impact preventable blindness by creating accessible technologies that are smart and simple to use.

Among only two significant use-cases, it can guide the design of first-in-human studies and generate insights for approaches patient populations non-responsive to current therapeutics.\"The Caris Life Sciences and ConcertAI collaboration includes unprecedented multi-modal datasets at scale, e.g., whole transcriptomes, whole exomes, digital pathology, clinical, imaging, and medical claims, combined with advanced technologies and scientific expertise. In a statement made on January 9th, David Spetzler, MS, PhD, MBA, Caris\\' President and Chief Scientific Officer, said, \"As precision oncology continues to evolve, Caris\\' cutting-edge work on tumor biology and molecular biomarkers combined with ConcertAI\\'s definitive clinical data at scale will have broad implications in the discovery and development of novel signatures and therapeutic options for patients across a range of tumor types.\"Complementing this Translational Platform is ConcertAI\\'s Digitally Accelerated Clinical Trials solution for oncology, developed in close working association with Bristol Myers Squibb, the world\\'s largest oncology company with a leading clinical-phase portfolio. The solution is in full production, having advanced the first consented and randomized patients in Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials in August of 2022. The solution is integrated into the research workflows of the clinical research sites such that clinical trials and research become no more complicated than practicing medicine according to the current standard of care. Commenting on the collaborative approach, BMS\\' Venkat Sethuraman, Senior Vice President - Global Biometrics & Data Sciences said, \"The Digital Trial Solution will allow us to accelerate access to innovative, lifesaving cancer medicines to patients. And we anticipate this approach will become BMS\\' gold standard for oncology studies in the future.\"The Digital Trial Solution is specific to the rather unique requirements of oncology clinical trials, where clinical, genomic, imaging and other data types need to be accessed and integrated. Our goals were to lower the burden on clinical sites and patients so that clinical trials could become more accessible in the community settings where majority of patients receive their care. This is also consistent with the FDA\\'s goals of assuring that trial populations more closely represent those ultimately receiving approved medicines. Marisa Co, BMS VP, R&D Business Insights & Analytics, further noted, \"Achieving our first participant enrolled through the Digitally Accelerated Clinical Trial (DACT) model has been a tremendous cross-functional effort and demonstrates BMS\\' commitment to use data and technology to simplify and accelerate the clinical research process.\"In 2023, ConcertAI is expanding its trial network across the U.S. in partnership with leading providers, clinical networks, and others. It is also implementing advanced solutions for patient matching to clinical trials, increasing automation tools to lower the support requirements for, or altogether eliminating the need to conduct, activities such as Source Data Verification (SDV).ConcertAI also reported on the continued progress of the company\\'s Patient360™ real-world data solution. In an industry first, Patient360™\\xa0will now include a combination of Structured Clinical Data; Abstracted Clinical Data processed in ConcertAI\\'s cloud software by cancer-specific Centers of Excellence; medical claims data to allow a broader view of prior history of disease, co-morbidities, oral medications, and use of health resources away from the cancer setting; and Social Determinants of Health to aid in Health Equity and Trial Diversity analyses. This data solution is the foundation to the company\\'s collaboration with the U.S. FDA that has been in place for a little over a year. Catherine Richards, ConcertAI Chief Data Officer, noted, \"We\\'ve seen an increase in use of our data products of 96% since late 2019, in part because of the close working relationship with have with the biopharma RWE communities. We want to assure that Patient360™\\xa0meets current and future biopharma research requirements by aligning it to the standard of care, capturing data associated with new guidelines, and standardizing key terminologies and concepts for complex areas, like line-of-therapy rules. The approach is working as publications in peer reviewed journals and presentations at medical society meetings based on our data have increased 72% over the last three years.\"In the past two years, ConcertAI has provided support to multiple biopharma companies using Patient360™\\xa0as part of their submissions, providing a valuable view on the current standard of care outcomes, especially for clinical programs targeting rare and non-responsive cancers.The company also provided a unique view on its business strategy, one founded on high value innovations in DaaS and SaaS solutions. But where the company\\'s ability to invest at, or ahead of peers, comes from superior financial performance. Dr. Elton noted, \"Some of our businesses today are already EBITDA positive and, as we close 2022, we expect they all will be, doing this while we increase our product investments.\" As part of that, investment in operations and internal automation are key. As an example of where new product technologies may drive efficiencies, while sustaining quality, ConcertAI noted in June of 2022, at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting, that it had achieved accuracy and recall in advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) solutions in oncology comparable to the company\\'s clinical human curation levels. This a first in a production solution for commercially available products in the industry.The company also announced two months ago the appointment of Ronan Brown, PhD, as Life Science Chief Operating officer. And, more recently, Jitendra Gupta joined in a new role as Managing Director of ConcertAI\\'s India subsidiary, where a new Clinical Development Center of Excellent and other advanced capabilities are being put into place.\"Over the past two years I\\'ve had the opportunity to witness the impressive impact of ConcertAI\\'s technologies and data solutions in improving cancer patients\\' outcomes,\" said Claudio D\\'Ambrosio, PhD., ConcertAI Chief Revenue Officer.

Scientists and developers are poking, prodding, exposing and comparing the capabilities and weaknesses of these tools. But there are equally important questions about exactly how they could affect our own skills and capabilities.The possibility of more sophisticated AI in the workplace raises an array of questions about its impact on human judgment and decision-making. Those include:Creativity: With its confident but frequently false statements, generative AI, especially those that create images, may have more to offer in fields where one answer isn\\'t required and a range of possibilities is acceptable or even desirable.In that sense, it could be \"a launchpad for creativity,\" my Axios colleague Ina Fried writes.AI could also redefine productivity in the workplace, says Tara Behrend, who studies industrial-organizational psychology at Purdue University.“If anyone can sneeze out 300 words with Chat GPT, maybe saying something original becomes productivity.\"\"It is going to produce cliches, and cliches aren’t actually valuable.\" But the bar for creativity or originality is subjective, and it could be unclear what is considered creative — for people and for AIs.Influence: The people around us can sway our decisions and conclusions. As AI enters the workplace, a big question is: \"What are the social influences that are likely to happen working with ChatGPT?\" says Gaurav Suri, an experimental psychologist and computational neuroscientist at San Francisco State University.\"Most people are not using it that way now, but I think that issue is coming.\"He points to a classic experiment about how people conform: Social psychologist Muzafer Sherif carried out experiments in the 1930s about social norms and conformity using what\\'s known as the autokinetic effect. If someone is placed in a dark room and shown a light, it appears to jump despite being stationary.Sherif asked study subjects — individually and then in groups — to estimate how far the light appeared to move.He found that in a group, people used other people\\'s estimates to refine their own — they conformed.\"How does this process change if we interact with an artificial agent in the same way as talking with fellow human beings?\" Suri asks. \"Would that interaction partner change the degree to which people stand behind an idea?\" Trust: When asked whether someone prefers a decision be made with the judgment of a human or an algorithm, most people say they prefer humans.So far, people seem to have \"a general distrust for machines and algorithms,\" says Chiara Longoni, a behavioral scientist at Boston University.But when people are asked about using human or algorithmic judgment to make specific predictions, they prefer algorithmic advice to human advice, says Jennifer Logg of Georgetown University, citing results from a series of studies by her and her colleagues in an unpublished working paper. The findings support earlier research.Longoni poses the question: \"How will the interaction with these highly sophisticated models change our perception of AI?\"Researchers are also interested in whether a conversation with a chatbot can provide inspiration like a chat with a colleague can, and whether co-creating with AI changes how meaningful work can feel, which Longoni is  studying.What to watch: If generative AI tools affect critical thinking, learning how to work with them — including how to prompt them to get the desired information — could become a new job skill on resumes.The bottom line:  “Asking how ChatGPT is changing the human response to things, that’s the brave new world,\" Suri says.Axios on facebookAxios on twitterAxios on linkedinAxios on emailGo deeperNews worthy of your time.Download the appAboutAbout AxiosAdvertise with usCareersEventsAxios on HBOAxios HQPrivacy and termsOnline tracking choicesDo not sell my personal informationContact usSubscribeAxios newslettersAxios ProAxios appAxios podcastsCoursesEarn Axios rewardsAxios  Homepage',\n",

Such is the scale of the task, that, fewer people have circumnavigated the world solo by boat than those who have reached the summit of Mount Everest or travelled to space.Bayanat, a G42 company based in Abu Dhabi that provides AI-powered geospatial intelligence solutions, is sponsoring Abhilash's participation in the race. The boat, aptly named 'BAYANAT' bears the race number 71, a tribute to 1971, the year in which the UAE came into being. Flying the UAE flag and the UAE ensign, as Abhilash set sail from France'sLes Sables-d'Olonne port he helped create history as the first UAE-registered boat to participate in this race.Over and above being a decorated Navy Commander, Abhilash is a sailing veteran. In 2012, he became the first Indian to complete a solo non-stop circumnavigation of the world by sea. He has also participated in several global sailing challenges, including the Cape Town to Rio Race in 2011, the Spanish Copa del Rey Race in 2014, and the Korea Cup in 20\",\n",

       " \" 08:27 pm  In virus-hit South Korea, AI monitors lonely elders  View PhotoSEOUL, South Korea — In a cramped office in eastern Seoul, Hwang Seungwon points a remote control toward a huge NASA-like overhead screen stretching across one of the walls.With each flick of the control, a colorful array of pie charts, graphs and maps reveals the search habits of thousands of South Korean senior citizens being monitored by voice-enabled “smart” speakers, an experimental remote care service the company says is increasingly needed during the coronavirus crisis.“We closely monitor for signs of danger, whether they are more frequently using search words that indicate rising states of loneliness or insecurity,” said Hwang, director of a social enterprise established by SK Telecom to handle the service. Trigger words lead to a recommendation for a visit by local public health officials.As South Korea’s government pushes to allow businesses to access vast amounts of personal information and to ease restrictions holding back telemedicine, tech firms could potentially find much bigger markets for their artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.The drive, resisted for years by civil liberty advocates and medical professionals, has been reinvigorated by a technology-driven fight against COVID-19. It has so far allowed South Korea to emerge as something of a coronavirus success story but also raised broader worries that privacy is being sacrificed for epidemiological gains.Armed with an infectious disease law that was strengthened after a 2015 outbreak of a different coronavirus, MERS, health authorities have aggressively used credit-card records, surveillance videos and cellphone data to find and isolate potential virus carriers.Locations where patients went before they were diagnosed are published on websites and released through cellphone alerts. Smartphone tracking apps are used to monitor around 30,000 individuals quarantined at home.Starting in June, entertainment venues will be required to register customers with smartphone QR codes so they could be easily located if needed.But there’s a dark side.People here have often managed to trace back the online information to the unnamed virus carriers, exposing embarrassing personal details and making them targets of public contempt.A low point came earlier this month when local media described some Seoul nightclubs linked to dozens of infections as catering to sexual minorities, triggering homophobic responses.Officials reacted by expanding “anonymous testing,” which allowed people to provide only their phone numbers and not their names during tests. There was a subsequent increase in tests.The past months have exposed a stark division about the best ways to make important decisions when privacy concerns collide with public health needs, said Haksoo Ko, a Seoul National University law professor and co-director of the school’s Artificial Intelligence Policy Initiative.Around 3,200 people across the country, mostly older than 70 and living alone, have so far allowed the SK Telecom speakers to listen to them 24 hours a day since the service launched in April 2019.The company expects users to at least double by the end of the year, judging by local government interest. The technology has reduced human contact in welfare services while still providing governments with a tool to prevent elderly residents from dying alone. That’s especially needed in a country grappling with an aging population and high poverty rates among retirees.The speakers are built with an artificial intelligence called “Aria” and a lamp that turns blue when processing voice commands for news, music and internet searches. The devices can also use quizzes to monitor the memory and cognitive functions of their elderly users, which would be potentially useful for advising treatments.But it’s difficult for SK Telecom’s clients to use the information without clear legal guidelines for handling health data on private networks.Similar reasons may also impede domestic use of health technologies developed by Samsung Electronics, which recently received approval for a smartwatch application that monitors blood pressure.KT, SK Telecom’s telecommunications rival, is focused on business customers, providing artificial intelligence devices such as speakers and service robots to hotels, offices and new apartments.President Moon Jae-in’s administration has said data-driven industries will be critical in boosting a pandemic-hit economy.Officials are preparing regulations for revised data laws that lawmakers passed in January after months of wrangling. They aim to allow businesses greater freedom in collecting and analyzing anonymous personal data without seeking individual consent.If they work as intended, optimists say the laws would allow artificial intelligence to truly take off and pave the way for highly customized financial and health care services after they start in August.But activist Oh Byoung-il said the changes could bring excessive privacy infringements unless robust safeguards are installed.“Companies will always have an endless thirst for data, but you can’t give it to them all,” he said.Doctors’ groups have also resisted government calls for legalizing telemedicine, raising concerns related to data security and a negative impact on smaller hospitals.Industrial benefits will be limited if officials can’t find the right combination of techniques to process personal information so that it can’t be used to identify individuals. Health and government authorities have failed to do this during the pandemic.South Korea’s anti-virus experience provides “lots of lessons and implications” as it steps toward a data-driven economy, Ko said.“With data, it’s bad to take ‘the more, the better’ approach,” he said. “An appropriate control system needs to be baked into the process, to make decisions on data access based on necessity and sensitivity and restrict access to information that isn’t really needed.”In Seoul’s Yangcheon district, officials are using SK Telecom’s tech to monitor some 200 seniors who live alone.Social workers, who have smartphone apps that look like a mini version of the main dashboard, make calls or visits when users don’t use their devices for more than 24 hours.“It’s nice to have something to talk to,” said Lee Chang-geun, an 89-year-old who has lived alone in his small apartment since his wife died three years ago. “But I wish they developed an Aria function for opening doors. What good is a distress signal if I die while emergency workers try to force open my door?”    Other Asia News In virus-hit South Korea, AI monitors lonely elders Nepal’s parties show rare unity on border dispute with India Street dog helps see Chinese nurse through virus traumas Quarantine bottlenecks add to woes of returning Filipinos Master of cargo ship charged over Australia container spillZookeeper critically mauled by 2 lions at shut Australia zooLawmaker-elect denies wrongdoing over ’comfort women’ funds    Other News            Make Us Your Home Page Today     Events30 Sat31 Sun 1 Mon 2 Tue 3 Wed Tuolumne Jamboree  | 10:00 am - 10:00 pmTuolumne Memorial Day Tuolumne Veteran's Memorial Hall | 10:00 am - 10:30 amSonora Certified Farmer's Market Sonora Farmers Market | 7:30 am - 11:30 am Curtis Creek School TK/K Registration  | 8:00 am - 3:00 pmTuolumne Jamboree  | 10:00 am - 10:00 pm Overeaters Anonymous/HOW 12 Step Meeting Sonora Alano Club | 5:15 pm - 6:00 pmMother Lode Storytime  | 10:15 am - 10:45 amCurtis Creek School TK/K Registration  | 8:00 am - 3:00 pm Farmers Market Lake Don Pedro/La Grange Lake Don Pedro Baptist Church | 9:00 am - 11:00 amSenior Farmers Market Tuolumne County Senior Center | 10:00 am - 12:00 pmCurtis Creek School TK/K Registration  | 8:00 am - 3:00 pm Mother Lode Storytime  | 10:15 am - 10:45 amFarmers Market Jamestown Program ATCAA Food Bank | 10:00 am - 12:00 pmFarmers Market Program Sugar Pine Mount Calvary Lutheran Church | 10:00 am - 12:00 pm CLICK HERE FOR ALL EVENTS Yellow Pages       Popular SearchesApartments in Sonora, CAAttorneys in Sonora, CAAuto Dealers in Sonora, CAAuto Parts in Sonora, CAAuto Repair in Sonora, CABeauty Salons in Sonora, CACar Rental in Sonora, CADentists in Sonora, CADoctors in Sonora, CAFlowers in Sonora, CAHotels in Sonora, CAInsurance in Sonora, CALoans in Sonora, CAMortgages in Sonora, CAMovers in Sonora, CAPizza in Sonora, CARealtors in Sonora, CARestaurants in Sonora, CAStorage in Sonora, CATax Preparation in Sonora, CATravel in Sonora, CAFeaturedMore...Local Radio StationsKVML AM 1450 / FM 102.7 - The Mother Lode's News StationKZSQ Star 92.7 FMKKBN 93.5 FM - CountryMoney   News:LocalStateUS NewsWorldMoneyTrafficPoliticsObituariesSchool DelaysSci/TechTourismWeather:Burn DaySchool DelaysSki/SnowSports:NFLMLBNBANHLSoccerCollege SportsHigh School SportsCommunity:EventsDining GuideHealthBlogsCommunity GuideDestination GuideRecreation GuidePet PatrolFire InfoEntertainment:MoviesTheatreHoroscopeGamesFood & RecipesDining GuideEventsKVMLKZSQKKBNDining Guide:All listingsSonora / Jamestown / ColumbiaTwain Harte, Tuolumne and AboveAngels Camp / Murphys / ArnoldCopperopolisReal Estate:FundamentalsFinanceHome ImprovementRelocationMaster GardenerClassifieds:JobsMerchandiseAutosReal EstatePromote EventsCommunityGarage SalesPets & AnimalsMore:AudioScanner 911WebcamsVideoBoard of SupervisorsT.U.D.Photo GalleryCouponsYellow Pages: Home About Us Feedback Site Map Advertise Help Report An Issue        Use the myMotherLode.com Keyword Search to go straight to a specific page   Popular Pages                         Terms of Service Privacy Policy  © Copyright 2000-2020 Clarke Broadcasting Corporation.

       " 'timer6 min. readMillennial Money is a weekly submission-based series that provides financial advice to millennials in the GTA. Read the full series here.After years of intense studies, David, 26, has landed a job as a data scientist making $120,000. Thankfully, he’s retained his job throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, but the uncertainty of the times led him to make a life-changing transition recently.He moved back in with his parents. That meant moving out of his downtown condo, sacrificing his independence, and relearning to cohabitate outside of the city — for example, adjusting to a lot more driving. “No more walking and transiting,” he says. Now it’s $300 to $400 added to his monthly bills driving his parent’s second car whenever he needs to go out. But because he’s working from home, he’s also saving a lot every month eating most of his meals at home. His parents provide the meals, along with rent-free shelter. “Before COVID-19, I was spending $2,000 plus in rent downtown and going out to eat for lunch on weekdays, which cost me $400 to 600 each month,” he says. “I also spent $100 to 200 a month on clothing because I felt I had to keep up appearances working downtown.” Before getting to his future goals, David still wants to use some of the money he’s saving from living with his parents to enjoy life. That means continuing to meet friends in his bubble at a restaurant twice a week to socialize and indulge in one of his favourite activities — eating. He also stresses the importance of not being too strict with spending. That means putting some money into a vacation fund — around $200 a month — that he can use when he feels safer to go overseas. He also allocates $400 a month for online educational courses. Other than his well-paying job, David is also interested in investments. “I feel that because I am young, I can invest aggressively.” With all his school debt paid off, he’s hoping to gain some insight into how he can start his future with what he has now. First goal? Buying his own home in the GTA within the year, and secondly “to be financially independent in my 40s.”“With the economic turbulence and headwinds we are facing, I’m struggling to save money because houses in the GTA are so expensive,” he adds.We asked David to record his day-to-day spending for a week to get a better idea of his finances.The expert: Jason Heath, managing director at Objective Financial Partners Inc., takes a look at David’s finances. David is in the sweet spot right now. He has a high income and he lives with his parents. The biggest risk of good cash flow is lifestyle creep that results from increased discretionary spending causing your saving potential to disappear. This is a good time for David to really ramp up his savings to get ready for the next phase in his life, as his expenses will no doubt rise in the future. He has a high income and will save 43 per cent tax on his RRSP contributions. He should be careful about building up too much RRSP funds too early — yes, there is a risk — because he will only be able to withdraw up to $35,000 for a home down payment under the Home Buyers’ Plan (HBP). He should also be contributing to a TFSA to have his savings build tax-free. If his timeline to purchase a home is one year, he should be conservatively invested with his down payment funds, likely in a savings account or other near-cash investment. Stocks fall about one-third of the time on an annual basis, so it would be unfortunate to invest aggressively and have to sell stocks if they were down a year from now.Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... I note David’s car insurance is pretty high at $280 per month. Maybe David drives a high-end car or has had tickets or accidents in the past. He might want to shop around his car insurance with an insurance broker. While he’s at it, his ability to work is his most important asset right now, so as a single person, he should be sure to protect against the risk of disability with good disability insurance coverage. Even if he has a group plan at work, he should determine whether it would be taxable or tax-free if he were disabled, and how much of his income it would actually replace. Also, many group policies become more strict with their definition of disability after two years, leaving some gaps that can be filled with private coverage. I like the way David has a monthly vacation fund he’s contributing to, even if the coming year may be a difficult time to travel given the pandemic. He should consider doing the same with his home purchase goal, working backwards from the target down payment he will need. First-time homebuyers are often surprised by some of the other costs of a home purchase, like provincial or city land transfer tax, legal fees, home inspection, new furniture, and so on. I would encourage David to develop a proper budget not only for the purchase, but also for the ongoing costs of owning a home. That way, he can figure out how much he should be spending to buy the home in the first place based on the budget that will leave him in a comfortable financial position post-purchase — not just based on what the bank approves him to borrow.Results: He spent less. Spending in week 1: $ 624.98 Spending in week 2: $255.46How he thinks he did: David is pretty satisfied with his week two spending. “I deliberately cut down on the discretionary spending, for example, by not buying a barbecue grill that I wanted for $350,” he says.Most of David’s recent impulse spending has come in the form of eating with friends, he says. “My idea is that if I just cut back a little on that, I can pay for other activities, like virtual board games,” noting the importance of staying busy during the pandemic. Take-aways: “The advice hit the nail on the head,” David says. “Certainly when I moved back home due to COVID-19, I felt like I was entitled to spend a bit more on myself because I was saving so much in rent.”RELATED STORIESPersonal FinanceAvocado toast didn’t wreck millennials’ budgets — COVID-19 did.

       " '     As the number of vehicles increases, road accidents are on the rise every day. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) survey, 1.4 million people have died, and 50 million people have been injured worldwide every year. The key cause of death is the unavailability of medical care at the accident site or the high response time in the rescue operation. A cognitive agent-based collision detection smart accident alert and rescue system will help us to minimize delays in a rescue operation that could save many lives. With the growing popularity of smart cities, intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are drawing major interest in academia and business, and are considered as a means to improve road safety in smart cities. This article proposed an intelligent accident detection and rescue system which mimics the cognitive functions of the human mind using the Internet of Things (IoTs) and the Artificial Intelligence system (AI). An IoT kit is developed that detects the accident and collects all accident-related information, such as position, pressure, gravitational force, speed, etc., and sends it to the cloud. In the cloud, once the accident is detected, a deep learning (DL) model is used to validate the output of the IoT module and activate the rescue module. Once the accident is detected by the DL module, all the closest emergency services such as the hospital, police station, mechanics, etc., are notified. Ensemble transfer learning with dynamic weights is used to minimize the false detection rate. Due to the dataset’s unavailability, a personalized dataset is generated from the various videos available on the Internet. The proposed method is validated by a comparative analysis of ResNet and InceptionResnetV2. The experiment results show that InceptionResnetV2 provides a better performance compared to ResNet with training, validation, and a test accuracy of 98%, respectively. To measure the performance of the proposed approach in the real world, it is validated on the toy car.',\n",

       " 'With high inflation hitting a 40-year high last autumn and the rising cost of living affecting up to 92% of households in the UK, according to Statista, customer behaviour is changing, causing complications for retailers. In the first week of the year, prices in stores increased by 8% to reach a record level.Retail trends for 2023 suggest what retailers could do to avoid having to cut margins but also to retain customers, who are increasingly looking for value deals and, as they become more price-conscious, are changing their shopping behaviour and keeping a close eye on their spending.Cloud-based analytics can help marketers collect, track and analyse data that is not stored in local systems but in the cloud. Companies can manage this data to identify trends and thus improve business results later on.Thanks to these analytics, businesses can monitor website traffic or even track production efficiency. Detailed insights allow retailers to create modern solutions that transform both business costs and customer satisfaction.For retailers, understanding customers and their behaviour is crucial, as is the subsequent response. It is the cost of living crisis that has changed this behaviour in a major way and, as prices have not yet stopped rising, it is necessary to speed up innovation and meet customer expectations.CTS, Sales Team Lead, Andrew Bithell believes \"this is where cloud technology is transforming retail, helping companies run sophisticated analytics across multiple data sets to drive vital innovation that will both reduce costs and improve experiences\".Read moreDangerous threats, violence against MPs have worsened since Jo Cox murderStrategies to Find Better Sales LeadsSamsung Galaxy S23 Ultra locks horns with iPhone 14 Pro Max in a speed test [WATCH]Using AI to reduce the number of abandoned baskets during shopping is an opportunity for retailers to minimise lost opportunities. Any item that is added to an online cart while shopping on an e-commerce site but never makes it through to a transaction is considered abandoned by the customer.Thus, the retailer loses the sale no matter if it was a large or small item. Factors that affect shopping cart abandonment such as complicated procedures to checkout or delivery costs are often responsible for this problem.The opportunity is to improve the way customers get the products they want. The number of clicks has an impact on the user experience on e-commerce sites. As a result of the reduction in clicks and the associated frustrations, the likelihood of purchase increases as it is easier to navigate the site.By using Natural Language Processing (NLP), AI can help in finding the desired product even in the case of misspelt or misspoken phrases. NLP technology catches misspellings with up to 98% accuracy and redirects the customer to the correct product.The customer will therefore not be forced to abandon their shopping cart. Thus, AI can help retailers minimise the number of abandoned goods in shopping carts, which is projected to reach around $4 trillion worth of merchandise.Customer perception and quality of experience are also an issue related to returns. Annually, free returns cost retailers in the UK £7 Billion. According to 2022 statistics from Drapers, up to 29% of clothing and footwear purchased is returned.Returns policies are also one of the biggest factors in shopping basket abandonment. For 67% of consumers, an unsatisfactory returns policy is a sufficient reason for cart abandonment.The opportunity for retailers is to optimise existing return methods. An example is the Swiss company Nespresso. The coffee company offers the option of collecting coffee capsules from the door when buying new ones and then recycling the used ones, which also contributes to improving the environment.This has been the case since 1991. In this way, in addition to the cost of returning the goods, the quality of the customer experience can be improved.',\n",

       " \"More industries are embracing artificial intelligence or tech meant to solve problems that humans traditionally have handled.Now the health care field is looking into it to ease the worker shortage and shorten hospital stays.A Wall Street Journal analysis estimates by 3 to 5 days.A startup called Viz.ai is developing technology that can read brain scans and suggest treatment options.New technology could also mean additional fees for patients associated with it.We went to a health benefits expert to see if AI in hospitals could really save us money in the long run.“We do have a history in our country of increasing the cost of health care when we make it more efficient, with technology, unfortunately, and that's pretty unique to this industry and most other industries,” said Paul Seegert at PCS Advisors.“When you look at the price of a piece of technology, it goes down over time. That hasn't been true in healthcare. Although I think we may see that start to happen in healthcare as well, when you get automation and technology involved and you're able to get better health outcomes, you will reduce cost,” Seegert said.He says AI helping providers make treatment more effective…could mean fewer people making return visits to the hospital.Health care workers having additional help with the several items they’re tasked with every day could also help prevent burnout.Some hospitals have started using AI technology for things like refilling prescriptions and setting appointments.“Not replacing the doctor that's making the diagnosis and deciding upon the treatment, but let's automate some of the other things down the line and make their life easier,” said Seegert.“Maybe we can bring some of the workforce back. We've lost 424,000 healthcare workers throughout the COVID experience and that trend seems to be continuing,” he added.Seegert says right now mostly bigger hospitals have been testing this out, but he expects it to expand.\",\n",

       " \" 7:15 PM GMT SHAREx HighlightsThe convergence of artificial intelligence and telecom is opening a lot of new possibilities  Artificial Intelligence has applications in all fields including telecommunications. Mobile data analytics, total network optimization, enhancing security, improvement of network operations, control of operational cost and network design are some of the areas where AI can be deployed. Prediction of consumer behaviour, introduction of such services which will be appreciated by him/her, launching of customised services, reduction of power consumption, improving resilience of the network, predictive maintenance, optimum utilisation of network elements, seamless provision of services and real time fraud detection and fraud prevention are other interesting applications of AI. As operators move from 4G to 5G implementation, network complexity and cost sharply increase because of implementation of Customer Experience Management (CEM), IOT, SDN (Software Defined Network), NFV (Network Function Virtualisation), 5G Radio access equipment and core infrastructure, 5G for private networks etc. But the average revenue per user is stagnating. This is the motivation for the operators to address the complexity of technology and reduce costs by using AI. TSPs can deploy AI to improve the efficiency of operations and manage OPEX and CAPEX, to understand and enhance the customer experience, to evolve from cell centric network to user centric network and to achieve new revenue streams by exploring new business models and 5G & IOT enabled use cases. AI can be used in cellular networks end to end. In the Radio Access portion, AI can be applied in achieving energy efficiency in view of deployment of massive MIMO (Multiple -Input Multiple-Output) technology, load & mobility management, optimization of radio resources in varying traffic conditions and harmonising the network so that radio access network and transport network are optimally utilised to benefit the customers. In Core Network & Data Centres, AI applications can be in trouble shooting, Incident detection & resolution, resources optimisation when traffic demands vary with time and ensuring high system availability & robustness. In Network planning & operations AI can be used for planning & design, provisioning of spectrum and complaint handling & resolution. Some specific use cases 1. Applying big data analytics to design RAN (Radio Access Network) for improving end customer experience. One lakh cells were analysed in 260 sites for 30 minutes for designing RAN. RAN performance improved by 120 per cent and there was 40 per cent time saving in the design. 2. In a traffic balancing use case, a high traffic scenario has been predicted 4 hours in advance in a particular cell (source cell) using Data labelling and correlation & prediction methodologies. Simultaneously traffic from the source cell was shifted to the other cell (target cell), driving through the closed loop automation. This has resulted in 10 per cent increase in throughput and 3 per cent increase in users. 3. A futuristic application of AI is Intent-based Networking. Let us say that a network operator's objective is to optimise a particular service in a particular area. Knowledge Reasoner translates this business intent into KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and discovers ML agent that can optimise the targeted KPIs. Trained ML algorithm triggers the model to give recommendation and prediction. Knowledge Reasoner evaluates business intent with the predicted model and implements the required configuration through a closed loop system. 4. Predicting the utilisation of MPLS links and upgrading them at the right time. 5. Anomaly detection in the network links which helps in taking proactive action instead of reactive one in a focused manner. Recurrent neural networks and clustering techniques are used in this use case. 6. Fault prediction based on various data sets using recurrent Neural Network models and initiating action in advance so that overall fault duration is reduced. 7. By clubbing AI, ML and robotics technologies BOT (robot) centre is created which replaces NOC (Network Operation Centre). The service personnel can interact with BOT centre and fix the faults leading to higher efficiency. Network upgradation at the sites from 4G to 5G is also being done expeditiously with the interaction with BOT by the engineering staff 8. AI/ ML can be leveraged for network quality prediction using Memory- augmented Tensorflow model. This model takes two inputs, the last 50 mins of network KPI data and the last 7days of network KPI data, to make network quality predictions for the next five minutes. 9. AI/ ML technology can be used by the management to take decisions on shut down of towers with short term low efficiency and also retiring towers with long term low efficiency. 10. DOT is analysing the subscriber database of all the TSPs through the use of advanced Data Analytics and AI to identify fraudulent mobile connections and also to identify customers who subscribed for more than a specific number of connections across all the TSPs in India. Face identification using AI for monitoring the number of mobile connections subscribed by a person. As per DOT norm, in view of security angle, a customer can have not more than nine mobile connections working anywhere in India across all the TSPs. Earlier since linking mobile numbers with Aadhaar numbers was mandatory (before Supreme Court verdict in 2018), it was easy for DOT to find out the number of mobile connections working against any Aadhaar number. Supreme Court verdict in 2018 made giving Aadhaar details voluntary for the prospective customer for obtaining a new connection. Linking mobile numbers of existing customers with their Aadhaar numbers is also stopped by the TSPs in view of the Supreme Court verdict. So, now storing facial images of customers available in the CAFs (Customer Application Forms) and comparing the facial image of prospective customers with the stored images using AI/ ML model will help the TSPs to ensure that DOT norm is not violated while issuing new mobile connections. When the prospective customer approaches the Customer Service Centre of the TSP, the details of mobile connections already working for him can be informed to him, after capturing his photograph and comparing it with the facial images of existing customers. If the customer declares that he has not subscribed to a particular connection, that connection can be deactivated by the concerned TSP. If the connections already working are more than nine, a new connection can be denied, unless he surrenders the existing one. For implementing the above, DOT should carry out Face image extraction from the CAFs of existing customers by suitable API (Application Programming Interface) and store it in a repository. SSFR (Simple Sample Face Recognition) and DeepFace (facial recognition system created by Facebook) approaches can be used for identification of image of the prospective customer. Way forward NITI Aayog has released a national strategy on AI for the design and development of advanced technology in India. The National Digital Communications Policy (NDCP) 2018 mandates for bringing in synergies for the deployment and adoption of AI. Trustworthiness of AI implementation is very important. Transparency, security, fairness, free from bias, giving access to data and meeting the national sovereignty requirements are expected in the AI implementation in any sector including telecom, for making responsible AI. The convergence of AI and Telecom is opening a lot of possibilities.

       " 'By contrast, characteristics that were considered to be hallmarks of COVID-19, like a particular pattern in lung images called \"ground glass opacity,\" fever and strong immune responses, were not useful in predicting which of the patients with initially mild symptoms would get ARDS. Neither age nor sex was a useful predictor either, even though other studies have found men over 60 to be at higher risk. \"It\\'s been fascinating because a lot of the data points that the machine used to help influence its decisions were different than what a clinician would normally look at,\" Coffee told AFP. Using AI in medical settings isn\\'t a brand new concept – a tool already exists to help dermatologists predict which patients will go on to develop skin cancer, to give just one example. What makes this different is that doctors are learning on the fly about COVID-19, and the tool can help steer them in the right direction, in addition to helping them decide which patients to focus on as hospitals become overwhelmed, said co-author Anasse Bari, a computer science professor at NYU. The team is now looking to further refine the tool with data from New York and hope it will be ready to deploy sometime in April.  ',\n",

       " 'AdvertisingAlphabet Inc\\'s Google this month plans to deploy an artificial intelligence (AI) feature that addresses the longstanding issue of darker skin tones being under-illuminated in video chats.Cisco Systems Inc in January launched a gesture-recognition feature to display a thumbs-up in Webex,taking pains to assure that skin tones would not affectperformance. LogMeIn Inc\\'s GoToMeeting, Microsoft Corp\\'s Teams and Facebook Inc\\'s Workplace are adding translation or pronunciation options in what they describe as an equity push.\"Technology is fundamentally today just not as inclusive as you want it to be,\" said Jeetu Patel, senior vice president and general manager for Cisco security and collaboration. Setting \"values and principles that a product should stand for\" has become essential, he said.Also Read | U.S. banks deploy AI to monitor customers, workers amid tech backlashThe tech industry has long been under fire for a poor record on workplace diversity and a failure to recognize the ways in which product design can perpetuate discrimination.Worries about bias in video conferencing picked up last September after Colin Madland, a doctoral student at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, Canada, tweeted a screenshot of a Black colleague appearing headless when deploying a virtual background on Zoom.Studies of other AI cropping systems have shown they generate more errors with darker skin, in part because the data used to train them mostly included lighter examples.Zoom\\'s chief diversity officer, Damien Hooper-Campbell, told Reuters: \"Bias was not at play, but rather a combination of the user\\'s distance from the camera, use of headphones, and seatingposition.\"Madland said the problem subsided after his colleague purchased a green screen and some \"snazzy lighting.\"For Zoom and its rivals, delivering on inclusion could provide an edge while vying for post-pandemic deals with clients - which are facing their own reckonings on diversity.Global spending on cloud-based conferencing is forecast to reach $5.41 billion this year, up from $5.02 billion in 2020,according to tech consultancy Gartner. It does not track market share, but analysts cite Zoom and Cisco as the leaders.\\'Not equally represented\\'The upcoming Google Meet feature tackles the problem of people appearing darker because of their surroundings, for example when sitting in front of a window, said Niklas Blum, a Google product leader involved with Meet.\"Users with dark skin tones are not equally represented, andwe want to build products for everyone,\" he said.The AI separates users from their background, determines whether they are underexposed regardless of their skin tone,brightens the picture accordingly, and finally merges the background and foreground.Meet\\'s virtual waiting room will prompt users to activate the lighting adjustment when it detects they could benefit from it, said Stéphane Hulaud, product lead for video quality and processing in Meet.Also Read | It was important the complex science in ‘Coded Bias’ be distilled but have integrity, says director Shalini KantayyaBlum and Hulaud said Meet first identified the representation issues in video when launching a low-light enhancement for mobile calls well before the pandemic. Developing the latest feature took considerable time, but it led Meet to establish product inclusion testing procedures and mandate them for all of its work.Google is pursuing additional fixes, too. Meet is pitching laptop makers and operating systems on sharing greater control over cameras\\' white balance and exposure. Internally, Google adopted minimum light reflectiveness requirements for conference room designs.At Cisco, the new gesture-recognition option, when turned on, lets users hold up their thumb on camera for about a second to generate a virtual thumbs-up on screen.Cisco trained its AI to focus on the shape outline and movement of the gesture in time and space, reducing potential issues from variance in skin tone, said Keith Griffin, a distinguished engineer at the company.Praying hands - for \"thank you\" - are among possible new gesture options to come, with a feature that interprets sign language an eventual goal. Webex also expects to add skin-tone options beyond yellow for the icons.Mike Sharp, LogMeIn\\'s chief product officer for unified communications and collaboration, said education clients have driven some of the company\\'s \"inclusion\" updates.For instance, forthcoming support for Spanish, Mandarin and other languages in voicemail prompts and transcriptions will benefit an unidentified California school district that wanted to better engage with its community, Sharp said.Facebook Workplace, a suite of business communication tools,last month said video town hall hosts soon would see name pronunciations for workers posing written questions.Product head Ujjwal Singh said the pointers, which are AI-generated but editable, aimed to help executives at clients including Nestle SA and Booking Holdings Inc properly address colleagues and promote inclusion.\"I don’t want to mispronounce it to thousands of employees and look like I\\'m not in touch with the company,\" he said.',\n",

       " ' /PRNewswire/ -- Segmed - in collaboration with NVIDIA and RadImageNet - today announced a joint effort to generate and commercialize synthetic medical imaging data for research and development.Segmed - in collaboration with NVIDIA and RadImageNet - today announced a joint effort to generate and commercialize synthetic medical imaging data for research and development.(PRNewswire)Segmed, NVIDIA and RadImageNet announce collaboration to generate and commercialize synthetic medical imaging data.As part of this initiative, Segmed will offer synthetic medical imaging data on their self-serve medical data curation platform, Segmed Insight. This is in addition to the 60M+ de-identified real-world imaging records that Segmed has access to in their data network.State-of-the-art generative imaging models were trained to generate synthetic data for CT, MRIs, Ultrasound, and Endoscopic surgery. These models can generate over 160 pathologic classifications, as well as create synthetic segmentations on top of the synthetic image frames. This data can then be used to train or augment downstream AI model training. Segmed is making said data available for licensing to researchers and companies doing medical research.In addition, Segmed is developing generative AI models to create high-quality synthetic images. These images will also be made available via their Insight platform in the coming months.By generating large quantities of synthetic images that closely mimic real-world data, this partnership will help to expand the availability of training data, while also augmenting the scope and variability of patient datasets. Potential use cases of the generated data include classification of modality, body part, and reconstruction plane. Synthetic data has the added benefit of protecting patient privacy, as synthetic records cannot be linked back to real patients.\"We\\'re thrilled to be working with NVIDIA and RadImageNet on this initiative, as this collaboration is a great step towards enhancing datasets used for research\" said Adam Koszek, CTO & Co-founder of Segmed. \"Supplementing the real-world data Segmed already provides with synthetic data can further increase the robustness and adaptability of our customers\\' AI algorithms and models.\"\"Generative AI for imaging is at an inflection point, and has the capability to truly democratize healthcare imaging data,\" said an NVIDIA representative. \"We\\'re excited to work with partners like Segmed and RadImageNet to make this a reality.\"The goal of this partnership is to accelerate the refinement of medical AI algorithms to improve the accuracy and consistency of medical diagnoses, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.About Segmed:Segmed\\'s mission is to revolutionize healthcare research by unlocking the unique information found in medical imaging studies so they can be applied to innovation.

       " \"BookmarkUnique South West supervillains generated by AI software MidjourneyWe asked a super-intelligent robot artist to create supervillains worthy of a Hollywood blockbuster based on South West places - and it terrified us. The new AI (artificial intelligence) software generated incredible illustrations of unnerving West Country characters based on the characteristics of different counties across the region.Image-generating AIs are trained on a gigantic volume of images from across the internet. Their algorithms process the wide range of images, and then when given human text prompts, they are able to produce unique photos, art and illustrations of virtually any subject in any style imaginable.They have taken the world by storm and exploded in popularity, with the software already improving massively since it became widely available in the last 12 months. Somerset Live has used Midjourney AI for an experiment aiming to create supervillains unique to places across the South West.READ MORE: We asked a super-smart artificial intelligence robot to write a Yeovil news articleWe asked the AI to create cinematic supervillains based on the landscape, people, history and traditions of individual counties across the region. The counties included are Somerset, Dorset, Wiltshire, Gloucestershire, Devon and Cornwall, as well as the City of Bristol.After being provided with short and simple text prompts for each county, the powerful software produced an array of remarkable characters within seconds. The villains are both fascinating and nightmare-inducing in equal measure.Cornwall's characters appear to draw on old tales of sailors and mermaids, while a huge stone giant can be seen emerging from the Jurassic coast cliffs of Dorset. In Bristol, an Avonmouth dock crane comes to life in frightening fashion, while in Somerset, a dragon is combined with an apple tree to create a horrifying entity.Every image created is completely unique, and you can see some of the supervillains below. They were all generated solely by the AI's algorithms, with no human input other than an original text prompt.The introduction of image-generating AI has sparked fears for the livelihoods of human artists and photographers. Concerns have been raised about the future of human creativity in the wake of super-smart AI artist bots.However, some people argue the software could be just another tool in the toolbox of content creators. The AI currently has limitations, and often struggles with basic aspects - including human faces and hands in particular.Midjourney has come under fire recently after CEO David Holz admitted that the software had been trained on millions of images sourced from across the internet containing work from artists and photographers at all levels without their approval or consent, and with no way of opting-out. The news has outraged some artists, and raised potential copyright infringement worries.You can take a look below at some of the terrifying South West supervillains generated by Midjourney AI.

       " ' Contacted by AFP, TikTok declined to discuss the technology behind the app, leaving an air of mystery on how Bold Glamour actually works. The company did insist that \"being true to yourself is celebrated and encouraged\" on the site and that effects help empower \"self-expression and creativity.\" \"We continue to work with expert partners and our community, to help keep TikTok a positive, supportive space for everyone,\" TikTok said in a statement. According to experts, Bold Glamour is using generative AI, following the same idea behind ChatGPT or Dall-E, apps that can churn out poems or art and designs on demand almost instantaneously. Petr Somol, the AI research director at Gen, a tech security firm, said these type of filters have existed for a couple of years, but TikTok\\'s latest version is \"pretty fine-tuned and well done\". Crucially, if Bold Glamour were indeed generative AI\\'s latest iteration, it would mean that the filter depends on goldmines of data to deliver its increasingly perfect effects. This dependency on big data comes as the Chinese-owned firm is under intense scrutiny by the United States and other western governments that fear the company\\'s ties to communist authorities in Beijing. \"The question is whether TikTok is really concerned with the implications of this new shiny thing,\" said Selepak. - Path to \\'deep fake\\' - Catfishing, scams, deep fakes: some wonder whether state-of-the-art filters are pointing to a world where the ability to misuse the technology is now at the fingertips of anyone with a smartphone. The latest filters \"are not necessarily a deep fake technology as such, but there is a relatively straightforward path extending in that direction,\" said Somol.Siwei Lyu, professor of computer science at the State University of New York at Buffalo, said it was unlikely that the major platforms like TikTok or Meta-owned Instagram would knowingly provide dangerous tools.But \"what makes them more dangerous is people who understand the technology could change it to help users evade being identified online\", opening new avenues for misuse, he added.

       " ' /PRNewswire/ -- Tech company Timekettle was recently invited to attend the Ottumwa Community School District Board Meeting in the U.S of Iowa to showcase its innovative AI translator earbuds, facilitating non-English speaking students to learn English and other curriculums. This award-winning product is the most powerful translator earbuds in the world and Ottumwa Schools are among many schools using it across the U.S. The joint effort by technology and educational institutions plays a significant part in providing equal access to all students.Co-founder of Timekettle Alex Qin with students wearing translator earbuds in Ottumwa School District(PRNewswire)The language barrier is a common challenge faced by English Language Learners (ELLs) and English as a Second Language (ESL) in multicultural classrooms, especially in English-speaking countries with high percentages of immigrants where school performance of students highly relies on proficiency in English. An effective way to communicate with ELLs is crucial for the Ottumwa school district, whose over 20% of its 5, 000 students speak 45 languages. The best solution available is Timekettle\\'s translator earbuds WT2 Edge, tiny yet powerful, which can translate up to 40 languages and 93 accents in real time, enabling natural and long-lasting conversations. And it\\'s not solely for language teaching but for math, science, etc. The goal is to flatten the learning curve in the initial stage, the quicker the students get proficient in English, the more confident they will be in achieving good grades.Timekettle\\'s world-first translator earbuds are embedded with the industry-leading HybridComm™ system, which subverts the shackles of conventional translation products - handheld translators and translation Apps are not user-friendly because people need to pass the device back and forth to each other - by adopting an entirely different technical design to advance products in speech processing, simultaneous interpretation, and AI translation.Currently, there are hundreds of WT2 Edge in use in the Ottumwa school district. The Co-founder of Timekettle, Alex Qin said, \"Timekettle will keep upgrading its hardware and software in Google Play to optimize the capability for Chromebook and user experiences in educational settings.\"About TimekettleEstablished in 2016, Timekettle is an industry-leading translation solutions provider recognized by winning numerous international awards such as CES Innovation Award, iF Design Award, and TechCrunch.

       " \"undefined minsBusiness Chief EMEA discusses the rise of human and AI collaboration in HR operations with Ray Joyce and Steve Gill HR Services at EY...In the last decade, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has been exponential. By the end of 2020, the AI industry is expected to have a total revenue of US$156.5bn, with 80% of emerging technologies having AI foundations as we enter into 2021. While the International Data Corporation (IDC) expects investment in AI to be impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19, the corporation still predicts that the worldwide revenue will surpass $300bn by 2024, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.1%.With this in mind, Business Chief spoke to Ray Joyce, Global Talent Predictive AI Lead, HR Services and Steve Gill, Global Talent AI Lead, HR Services at EY to discuss the rise of human and AI collaboration in HR operations.\\xa0Working in the industry, Joyce identifies two major trends that are currently occurring in the industry, “I think one major trend that is being shown at the present time is to provide HR and, in turn, organisations with greater insight to their data.” He highlights that harnessing machine learning at an organisational level helps identify trends in data which may not have been easily identified before. “From an employee perspective, the biggest trend is most definitely chatbots – which not only provide a fast and reliable place for an individual to have questions answered but also a safe environment, they can ask any question they like and get a personalised answer back in real time.”While agreeing with Joyce, Gill does predict that the future will move away from using AI solely for insights in data and chatbots, and become more centred around automation. “This is already being seen in chatbots which are beginning to replace (in a limited fashion) Employee Self-Service portals and beginning to carry out transactions, such as a change of address. This level of automation will only increase as companies become more confident in allowing AI to complete tasks on behalf on an individual,” comments Gill, who adds that “for instance, a recruiter could raise a new requisition; as soon as this has been completed, the system has already reviewed the current talent pool(s) available and made recommendations on who would be a good fit – and more critically why. Process mining can review current HR processes and make recommendations on savings based on budgets, time and people.”identifying that talent is the most expansive resource that an organisation has, and typically the most expensive. Joyce explains that, while the digital footprint that employees generate on a daily basis is significant, many companies do not always ‘know’ their people. AI allows talent teams to analyse the data in ways that they have never been able to in the past. With this insight also comes the ability to automate many tasks based on the data in a way that is not only consistent but also objective.” However, Gill comments that while this is certainly a benefit for organisations, “HR data is not always ‘clean’ - as any company that has done a data migration will know - so there may be tasks needed to ready the data. Once this has taken place, it will be of utmost importance that the rules and mechanisms used follow the organisation's inclusion, equality and diversity principles, so that trust can be achieved.”While there are a lot of AI solutions out there, Joyce states that organisations must “see through the ‘sales’ and ensure that the solutions are tied to key metrics within the business case. Start small - but think big!”Agreeing with Joyce, Gill explains that when it comes to developing an effective AI adoption strategy, it is important to “ensure that there is an ethics and bias review team in place which contains members of the HR team. Ensure that every step of the journey they are part of the team and understand the AI. Ensure HR knows that they own the solution and that it is their AI. In addition, do not plan or structure your strategy so that you have to have everything 100% accurate; AI needs to learn and to make mistakes, bring your employee base with you, let them have a say in what they want so that solutions are meaningful to them. It’s all fine having the most techy, whizzy solution, but if it is not what the employee or business wants, then basically it just turns into an expense and the budget could have been used elsewhere.”Further to Gill’s explanation of an effective strategy, Joyce adds that “it is important that HR teams feel involved in the AI solutions. AI should not be ‘done to’ but ‘with’. Most of the data or processes that AI will change or replace will be owned by the HR or People teams and it is very important that the ownership stays with them. Letting the HR team have a say in how the AI will operate will help drive the adoption and take away uncertainty. It is important that content owners trust the AI to make the right decision or answer the question correctly, especially in an area like HR.”Ultimately Joyce concludes that when it comes to the collaboration of humans and AI in HR operations, “An open mind is critical. Technology is changing rapidly and what may be true today can change tomorrow.” As a result, organisations need to be agile in their thinking. Joyce also highlights that emerging technology is not perfect to begin with, and there may be failures along the way. “Having strong stakeholders, a resilient culture, and accepting potential failures as a learning curve instead of a reason to stop will allow companies to keep moving forward, and then ultimately reap huge rewards.”For more information on business topics in Europe, Middle East and Africa please take a look at the latest edition of Business Chief EMEA.Follow Business Chief on LinkedIn and Twitter.\\xa0EYhuman capitalAIcollaborationShareShareRelatedContentEurope’s top 8 CEOs building brand and business valueLeadership & StrategyExclusive: EY Global Vice Chair Sustainability, Steve VarleySustainabilityPeople Moves UK: Unilever, Standard Chartered, AccentureHuman CapitalHR, tech, ESG dominate fastest-growing UK rolesHuman CapitalFeatured ArticlesFrom apprentice to CEO – climbing the corporate ladderTo celebrate UK National Apprenticeship Week, we spotlight 8 chief executives in Europe who began as apprentices and rose through the ranks to run the show…Swiss multinational SGS begins rollout of digital SquadsIn a drive towards becoming the digital leader in the TIC industry, SGS launches state-of-the-art digital operations which it plans to roll out worldwide…Report: 3 in 5 UK tech firms say they are behind in DE&IResearch by global consultancy Thoughtworks shows 3 out of 5 UK tech businesses say they have work to do on diversity, equality and inclusion (DE&I)…Long-stay, tailored, outdoor – what travellers want in 2022Leadership & StrategyMeet the CEO: Why Jonathan Akeroyd is bossing luxury goodsLeadership & StrategySail of the century for CDPLCSustainability83% of UK jobs have a gender pay gap, says CIPHR studyCo-op influences climate change through store rebrandingKeelvar's sourcing team focuses on supply chain managementContinental to Develop Engine Mounts for EV ManufacturersInterbrand highlight Best Global Brands in the latest reportThe focus of Business Chief's Digital Community is to provide our users with the Ultimate Digital Experience - an incredible digital magazine, a world-class website, an award-winning newsletter service as well as video reports, podcasts, blogs, webinars, white papers, research reports, virtual events and a database second to none.Join CommunityContentContentMoreMoreSocialsLinkedInTwitterFacebookInstagramYouTubeMediumAdvertise with BMGUser AgreementPrivacy Policy\",\n",
       " '  6:15 am   Share Tweet Share Share Share Print Email Seeking to keep things ethical in the development of artificial intelligence (AI), the European Union wants to enact legally binding requirements for makers of the technology.Their executive arm is set to propose new rules that apply to “high-risk” sectors, like health care and transport. High risk is defined here as applications of AI that could have legal risks or could potentially cause injuries.They will suggest that the bloc update the rules for safety and liability. The information comes from a draft of a “white paper” obtained by Bloomberg. The European Commission is due to unveil the paper next month, and what Bloomberg reported on will likely not be the final version.The paper is part of a broader effort by the EU to catch up to the U.S. and China, which have both had more advancements on AI. But the paper will also promote European values like privacy.Critics say that stringent data protection laws like the EU’s could hinder innovation around AI, but EU officials say they want to harmonize and streamline rules in the region. The effect will be a boost to development.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said her team would present a different legislative approach to AI within the first 100 days of her mandate, which started Dec. 1. She’ll be handing the task to EU digital chief Margrethe Vestager to coordinate everything.Facial recognition is among the things the EU might look at regulating. The documents obtained by Bloomberg state that the EU wants to urge its member states to apply stricter and more detailed rules around facial recognition technology, especially on its use in public spaces.The provision suggests prohibiting the use of facial recognition in both private and public until the risks of the technology can be properly assessed.The report outlined a set of objectives that could rule AI safe and trustworthy, including human oversight, respect for privacy, traceability and avoiding unfair bias when the systems make decisions.The U.S. is surging in patents for artificial intelligence, with around 50 percent of IBM’s new patents related to the tech. And in China, artificial intelligence has also been a huge boon, reshaping their financial services landscape.——————————–',\n",

Autor de la imagen: WilfredorInformal settlements, also known as slums, shantytowns, camps or favelas, depending on the country in question, are uncontrolled settlements on land where, in many cases, the conditions for a dignified life are not in place. Through self-built dwellings, these sites are generally the result of the continuous growth of the housing deficit.For decades, the possibility of collecting information about the Earth's surface through satellite imagery has been contributing to the analysis and production of increasingly accurate and useful maps for urban planning. In this way, not only the growth of cities can be seen, but also the speed at which they are growing and the characteristics of their buildings.Save this picture!San Juan de Lurigancho, Lima, Perú. Imagen de MarcoRosales. Image via ShutterstockAdvances in artificial intelligence facilitate the processing of a large amount of information.\\xa0When a satellite or aerial image is taken of a neighbourhood where a municipal team has previously demarcated informal areas, the image is processed by an algorithm that will identify the characteristic visual patterns of the area observed from space.\\xa0The algorithm will then identify other areas with similar characteristics in other images, automatically recognising the districts where informality predominates.\\xa0It is worth noting that while satellites are able to report both where and how informal settlements are growing, specialised equipment and processing infrastructure are also required.

In fact, it is estimated that by 2050 it will increase by 28% with an urban population in equal or greater proportion. Thus, there is a real need to build new urban homes.  Related article: Is Informality Part of the Problem or the Solution? The Medellin Case Study  The Government of Colombia appointed the National Planning Department (DNP) to support the Ministry of Housing in defining new methodologies to address the problem of informal housing. In 2021, the DNP was supported by the Housing and Urban Development Division of the IDB and the company GIM and carried out a pilot project using artificial intelligence to obtain detailed information on Colombian informal housing.

       " 'Financial solutions for farmers Banks and other financial institutions do not have adequate data on crop performance and farmer incomes. Data science solutions on farmlands and cultivation trends can help financial services companies to improve their underwriting of loans and insurance products for agri-related financing. High variable costs and limited access to underwriting data make lending and insuring farmers an unviable business, particularly in India where majority of farmers own small tracts of land. However, new-age solutions are now using satellite imagery and combining non-traditional data sets such as weather data and satellite imagery to track cultivation progress and weather patterns. Such solutions can help predict farm-level yields and enable financial institutions to help farmers with insurance products and loans for working capital and capex for farmlands.Building integrated supply chains COVID-19 has emphasised the need to build integrated supply chains. Crisis or not, you still need food on the table. Data-led and tech-enabled processes enhance procurement capabilities, farm-level traceability, and tracking, thereby ensuring a smoother supply chain and helping reduce food wastage.Business models in other markets have proven the viability of using data in agriculture. Several companies have recognised these applications of data science to solve agricultural challenges. For instance, Monsanto, a leading agricultural company, acquired Climate Corp, a digital agriculture company that uses weather, soil, and field data to help farmers make optimal farming decisions. DuPont acquired Granular, Inc., a provider of software and analytics tools that help farms improve efficiency, profitability, and sustainability. The last decade has also witnessed an increase in agri-tech investing by sector-focused and early-stage generalist funds.Why nowIndia has the second-largest road network in the world. Connectivity between cities, towns, and rural markets has also gradually improved over the last decade. Most Indian villages now have access to electricity. Infrastructure in India is ready to give a digital makeover to the agriculture sector. India has over 1 billion mobile phone connections and over 500 million smartphone users. Backed by the lowest mobile data rates in the world, India is more than ready for digitisation.Road aheadThe cost of mobile data and technology costs (IoT devices, controllers, chipsets) have significantly reduced over the last decade. Smartphone penetration and the use of mobile devices would continue to rise. India is rapidly digitising, and this will produce vast quantities of data. The number of companies that use data to improve farmer incomes and farm productivity is on the rise. The digital revolution of the agricultural sector has already begun, and many innovative businesses will find their niche while collectively addressing the sector’s most pressing needs.(Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of YourStory.)India’s most prolific entrepreneurship conference TechSparks is back!

(WAFF/Gray News) - As scams using artificial intelligence spread across the country, one Alabama family is sharing their story to warn others.Experts explain that the scam uses AI to replicate the voice of a loved one with the intention to steal your money.Natalie Tease was at home watching a YouTube video when her phone mimicked a call from her daughter, Olivia, and a voice, that sounded exactly like her came through the speakers, screaming that her husband is dead.Tease said the voice’s words made her heart drop.“I picked up the phone to listen to it and it was Olivia’s voice screaming hysterically, ‘Mom help me, help me. Will’s dead. Help me,’” she said.Tease and her husband were terrified, as they both believed that the voice was really that of their daughter.Tease immediately called her daughter’s actual number, ending the AI conversation.Experts say that is typically how the scam starts, with the voice of a loved one crying and relaying tragic news. Then, experts say, the voice will typically ask for financial aid for their emergency situation.Tease said the conversation was over before the scammers could ask for money, but she says she knows what she would have done if the conversation took that turn.“I probably would have done anything they asked for at that moment,” she said.Cyber security expert Marcus Sachs said these AI scams are rapidly spreading across the county. He says the criminals choose a victim and gather information, like the audio of a loved one’s voice and public information about a tragic event. Then they craft an AI persona and strike.Sachs suggests asking to call your loved one back if you think the call is a scam. Another sign that it could be a scam is if the caller urges you to not hang up.As for Olivia, whose last name was withheld, she said the progression of AI in modern society is no longer something she supports.“Initially when this stuff started coming out it was interesting, but then for it to be warped into this evil stuff that’s going on, it’s just tragic,” Olivia said.The family now plans to develop a safe word to be sure it’s their loved one on the other end of the line.Copyright 2023 WAFF via Gray Media Group, Inc.

       " ' /PRNewswire/ --\\xa0Kettle, the reinsurance startup that uses advanced deep learning to better protect people from the growing risks associated with climate change, such as California\\'s wildfires, today announced it has been reinsuring homes during the 2021 wildfire season and that it raised a Series A financing round. The $25 million round was led by Acrew Capital, with participation from Homebrew, True Ventures, Anthemis, Valor, DCVC, and LowerCarbon Capital.CA Kettle Risk MapKettle Raises $25 Million Series A Led by Acrew Capital to protect against wildfires.Kettle is bringing advanced technology to the $400 billion-a-year reinsurance industry, starting with California wildfires. The industry has seen a 68 percent drop in return on equity due to a 3X increase in catastrophes causing more than $1 billion in damage over the past 15 years according to NOAA. In 2021 we saw the Dixie and Caldor Fires in California burn over 700,000 acres and destroy over 1200 structures based on Calfire\\'s data.Founded by Andrew Engler and Nathaniel Manning, Kettle is structured as a reinsurance Managing General Agent that can underwrite these increasing risks. Kettle is also setting up their own risk-bearing entity. Kettle\\'s Engler has more than a decade of experience working in the insurance and reinsurance industries, most recently as the vice president of digital at the public insurer/reinsurer, Argo Group. Manning spent years working with data for humanitarian efforts as the CEO of Ushahidi, the largest open source software platform for community crisis response, and as the first chief data officer of USAID.\"We are thrilled to be helping provide insight and relief to the California insurance market,\" said Manning.\"There are 14 million structures in California, and in 2020 ~11,500 of them burned down, less than .1%. While the risks of wildfire have certainly increased over the past decade, the key is understanding exactly where the risk is. If we can do that, we can bring stability back to the California insurance market.\"In 2020, Kettle\\'s model predicted that the fourteen largest fires, which accounted for 98% of the damage, were in the top 20 percent of areas most likely to burn across California\\'s hundred plus million acres. In 2021, Kettle\\'s model predicted the areas consumed by the Dixie and Caldor Fires as some of the most dangerous parts of California.Kettle\\'s technology and proprietary algorithms use terabytes of data from public and private data sources, such as NOAA weather data and NASA\\'s MODIS and LIDAR satellites. Kettle\\'s neural networks run upward of 140 million model parameters to calculate probabilities of fire damage at the half square mile resolution across the state.\"When you take a minute to think about it, it becomes very obvious why traditional reinsurers can\\'t accurately underwrite climate risk -- their methodologies\\xa0 look to the past,\" says Lauren Kolodny, Partner at Acrew Capital. \"And our climate is changing in ways that can\\'t be predicted on the basis of historical data. Kettle is solving a massive, global problem. And we\\'re so thrilled to deepen our partnership with this incredible team.\"\"Climate change is here, it\\'s right there in the words - the climate has changed\" says Manning. \"Now we need to build the best safety net we can to help people recover from these catastrophes.\"About Kettle\\xa0 Kettle\\xa0uses deep learning and proprietary algorithms to reshape the reinsurance industry and better protect people from the growing risks associated with climate change. Kettle\\'s first product protects Californians\\' businesses, homes, and livelihoods with wildfire reinsurance.

       " ' /PRNewswire/ -- As schools and teachers across our nation continue to navigate how to address the critical need of differentiated reading comprehension instruction, two edtech organizations have partnered to help teachers through artificial intelligence. The goal of reading comprehension instruction is to equip all students with the knowledge and skills they need to read and meaningfully engage with texts. To be able to support each of their students every day and move the needle on reading comprehension, educators need real-time data on the most appropriate materials to provide increasingly challenging assignments toward the goal of grade-level reading or going above grade-level when possible. This is especially important as schools are working to help students catch up to grade level in the wake of the pandemic, and the evidence in our partner publication with TNTP shows that students need more access to\\xa0 grade-level work.Teachers may now see this (PRNewswire)This recommendation engine will provide teachers with increasingly challenging texts for students, especially those in low-income communities.ReadWorks, in partnership with Tailor-ED,\\xa0announces a program that directly supports the student learning experience and reading outcomes through an artificial intelligence recommendation engine. With this new feature, ReadWorks provides teachers with recommendations for their students based on past assignments and student performance. A teacher sees recommendations within their personal interface for similar topical and vocabulary-based readings to continue helping students build background knowledge and vocabulary and to tackle more challenging texts when they are ready to progress. Similar to other service-oriented video streaming and gaming platforms, ReadWorks and Tailor-ED are striving to create more data-enhanced, engaging, and meaningful individualized reading and learning experiences.\"The AI-powered engine from Tailor-ED has the potential to revolutionize the learning industry by delivering personalized experiences that are tailored to the needs and interests of individuals. Our work with Readworks will help to bring this vision to life and make a meaningful impact in the learning industry.\" - Eran Raviv, CEO of Tailor-EDReadWorks provides 1.2 million K-12 teachers and 17 million students with content, curricular supports, and digital tools designed to improve teacher instruction and student achievement in reading comprehension—all completely free of charge and\\xa0 with a focus on the priority audience of low-income schools.Three outcomes will determine success for this project.Personalized learning: To grow reading comprehension, students need access to grade-level assignments. By using an AI-powered engine to deliver personalized learning experiences, students will receive content and resources tailored specifically to their needs and interests. Recommendations will use past performance to scaffold students to on-grade-level reading and ensure that, when students have mastered texts at one level, they have the opportunity to tackle more challenging material.Diverse content: By expanding the exposure of students to diverse content, students\\' understanding of different perspectives and cultures increases. Early research has also shown that students of diverse backgrounds tend to perform better on fluency and comprehension measures when the passages used in intervention work and on the assessments themselves are familiar.Improved access: By providing teachers with custom content recommendations through a recommendation API, it will be easier for teachers to find and use relevant and high-quality resources in the classroom.

       " ' /PRNewswire/ -- Crowdsourcing has become an increasingly popular way to develop machine learning algorithms to address many clinical problems in a variety of illnesses. Today at the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) annual meeting, a multicenter team led by an investigator from Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) presented the results from the RA2-DREAM Challenge, a crowdsourced effort focused on developing better methods to quantify joint damage in people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).HSS Logo (PRNewsfoto/Hospital for Special Surgery)Damage in the joints of people with RA is currently measured by visual inspection and detailed scoring on radiographic images\\xa0of small joints in the hands, wrists and feet. This includes both joint space narrowing (which indicates cartilage loss) and bone erosions (which indicates damage from invasion of the inflamed joint lining). The scoring system requires specially trained experts and is time-consuming and expensive. Finding an automated way to measure joint damage is important for both clinical research and for care of patients, according to the study\\'s senior author, S. Louis Bridges, Jr., MD, PhD, physician-in-chief and chair of the Department of Medicine at HSS.\"If a machine-learning approach could provide a quick, accurate quantitative score estimating the degree of joint damage in hands and feet, it would greatly help clinical research,\" he said. \"For example, researchers could analyze data from electronic health records and from genetic and other research assays to find biomarkers associated with progressive damage. Having to score all the images by visual inspection ourselves would be tedious, and outsourcing it is cost prohibitive.\"\"This approach could also aid rheumatologists by quickly assessing whether there is progression of damage over time, which would prompt a change in treatment to prevent further damage,\" he added. \"This is really important in geographic areas where expert musculoskeletal radiologists are not available.\"For the challenge, Dr. Bridges and his collaborators partnered with Sage Bionetworks, a nonprofit organization that helps investigators create DREAM (Dialogue on Reverse Engineering Assessment and Methods) Challenges. These competitions are focused on the development of innovative artificial intelligence-based tools in the life sciences. The investigators sent out a call for submissions, with grant money providing prizes for the winning teams. Competitors were from a variety of fields, including computer scientists, computational biologists and physician-scientists; none were radiologists with expertise or training in reading radiographic images.For the first part of the challenge, one set of images was provided to the teams, along with known scores that had been visually generated. These were used to train the algorithms. Additional sets of images were then provided so the competitors could test and refine the tools they had developed. In the final round, a third set of images was given without scores, and competitors estimated the amount of joint space narrowing and erosions. Submissions were judged according to which most closely replicated the gold-standard visually generated scores. There were 26 teams that submitted algorithms and 16 final submissions. In total, competitors were given 674 sets of images from 562 different RA patients, all of whom had participated in prior National Institutes of Health-funded research studies led by Dr. Bridges. In the end, four teams were named top performers.For the DREAM Challenge organizers, it was important that any scoring system developed through the project be freely available rather than proprietary, so that it could be used by investigators and clinicians at no cost. \"Part of the appeal of this collaboration was that everything is in the public domain,\" Dr. Bridges said.Dr. Bridges explained that additional research and development of computational methods are needed before the tools can be broadly used, but the current research demonstrates that this type of approach is feasible. \"We still need to refine the algorithms, but we\\'re much closer to our goal than we were before the Challenge,\" he concluded.About HSSHSS is the world\\'s leading academic medical center focused on musculoskeletal health. At its core is Hospital for Special Surgery, nationally ranked No. 1 in orthopedics (for the 12th consecutive year), No. 4 in rheumatology by U.S. News & World Report (2021-2022), and the best pediatric orthopedic hospital in NY, NJ and CT by U.S. News & World Report \"Best Children\\'s Hospitals\" list (2021-2022). HSS is ranked world #1 in orthopedics by Newsweek (2021-2022). Founded in 1863, the Hospital has the lowest complication and readmission rates in the nation for orthopedics, and among the lowest infection rates. HSS was the first in New York State to receive Magnet Recognition for Excellence in Nursing Service from the American Nurses Credentialing Center five consecutive times. The global standard total knee replacement was developed at HSS in 1969. An affiliate of Weill Cornell Medical College, HSS has a main campus in New York City and facilities in New Jersey, Connecticut and in the Long Island and Westchester County regions of New York State, as well as in Florida. In addition to patient care, HSS leads the field in research, innovation and education.

       " ' /PRNewswire/ --\\xa0Rad AI, the fastest growing radiologist-led AI company, today announced $25 million in Series A funding. The round was led by ARTIS Ventures with participation by several existing investors, including OCV Partners, Kickstart Fund, and Gradient Ventures (Google\\'s AI-focused fund). The funding will drive further development and commercialization of Rad AI Omni and Rad AI Continuity, the company\\'s first core offerings on its AI platform, and advance Rad AI\\'s mission to empower radiologists with AI — saving them time, reducing burnout, and helping to improve the quality of patient care.Rad AI LogoHow Rad AI Helps Radiologists and Improves Patient CareFounded in 2018, Rad AI has seen rapid adoption of its AI platform, and is already in use at 7 of the 10 largest private radiology practices in the United States. Rad AI uses state-of-the-art machine learning to streamline repetitive tasks for radiologists, which yields substantial time savings, alleviates burnout, and creates more time to focus on patient care. Its first product, Rad AI Omni, saves radiologists an average of 60 minutes per day, and helps achieve up to 20% time savings per report.In October, Rad AI was recognized as the Best New Radiology Vendor by AuntMinnie. AuntMinnie.com is the largest community website for medical imaging professionals worldwide, and the Minnies have been the premier awards event in radiology since 2000.\"At Rad AI, we\\'ve always believed that AI will augment and benefit radiologists, not replace them,\" said Doktor Gurson, co-founder and CEO of Rad AI. \"Radiology is an extraordinarily complex field, of which image pattern recognition is only a small part. By building products that put the radiologist and patient first we\\'ve been able to break through the noise and focus on what really matters -- reducing radiologist fatigue and improving patient care.\"Rad AI Omni automatically generates a customized impression from the findings and clinical indication dictated by the radiologist, using the most advanced neural networks. It learns each radiologist\\'s language preferences from all of their prior reports, to create an impression that the radiologist can simply review and finalize. In addition, Rad AI Omni improves report accuracy and consistency by making sure to include significant incidental findings, answering the main clinical question, and providing consensus guideline recommendations for follow-up. The impression appears in the practice\\'s voice recognition software as soon as the radiologist finishes dictating the findings, without any clicks, hotkeys or new windows.\"It\\'s important to us to remain at the forefront of implementing groundbreaking technology to best serve our patients and provide the optimal environment for our radiologists to do their best work,\" Dr. Casey Schmitz, neuroradiologist and physician lead for the AI Workgroup at Inland Imaging. \"Our radiologists are impressed with the efficiency gains, quality gains, and reduction in fatigue. Rad AI is an ideal partner that is both innovative and customer-focused, and places a premium on developing long-term partnerships.\"Rad AI\\'s second product, Continuity, closes the loop on follow-up recommendations for significant incidental findings in radiology reports. Using AI-driven automation, Continuity ensures that appropriate patient follow-up is communicated and completed. This improves patient outcomes, reduces health system liability, and drives new financial value for health systems and radiology practices. Continuity integrates directly into health systems\\' EMR, and also has a platform available for outpatient imaging.Made for Radiologists, by RadiologistsRad AI co-founder Dr. Jeff Chang is the youngest radiologist and second youngest doctor in U.S. history. After working over a thousand overnight shifts as an ER radiologist for the past decade, he clearly saw some of the biggest problems radiologists face - fatigue and burnout, errors in reporting, and a shortage of radiologists despite rising imaging volume. After pursuing graduate work in machine learning, he co-founded Rad AI to provide ways to help radiologists using the latest advances in AI.\"Radiology is central to medical diagnosis and patient care; the radiology report is key to correct diagnosis, appropriate treatment, and monitoring of disease progression. When it comes to high-quality patient care, radiologists make all the difference,\" said Dr. Chang. \"By using AI to streamline radiologists\\' workflow and reporting, our goal is to positively transform radiology with the latest advances in technology - keeping the radiologist top of mind and the patient at heart.\"\"AI is now serving as a critical skill multiplier for physicians, allowing for significant improvements in patient outcomes and overall healthcare costs,\" said Stuart Peterson, founder and managing partner of ARTIS Ventures. \"Within healthcare, radiology is a key part of medical diagnosis and treatment, and ideally suited to leverage the power of AI and machine learning. Rad AI\\'s recent and significant momentum is a function of these tailwinds and its unique position - it has been built for radiologists by radiologists, transforming the field with this inside perspective as its driving force. We believe they are set to unlock enormous value for the entire healthcare imaging ecosystem.\"About Rad AIRad AI streamlines the radiology workflow, providing time savings for radiologists and improving report consistency, while helping reduce radiologist burnout. Co-founded by the youngest US radiologist on record, Rad AI is working with 7 of the 10 largest private radiology practices in the U.S. and expanding quickly.

       " ' /PRNewswire/ -- Precision Neuroscience Corporation announced this week that it has filled two technical leadership positions, advancing its efforts to build the data, machine learning, and software infrastructure that will power the next generation of brain-computer interface technology.Brain-computer interface startup Precision Neuroscience hires technical leads from Google and Apple.Craig Mermel\\xa0has joined the company as President and Chief Product Officer, overseeing its use of data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Mermel is an expert in the application of machine learning in healthcare. He comes to Precision from Google, where he led a group of data scientists, clinicians, and engineers exploring the use of artificial intelligence to diagnose and treat a wide variety of cancers. Before that, he spent four years at Apple, managing a team that developed health and fitness features for the Apple Watch. He also worked for nearly a decade as a researcher at the Broad Institute, where he built machine learning tools that have been used to identify key genes implicated in cancer.Dan Trietsch\\xa0will serve as Principal Software Architect. He has twenty-five years of software engineering experience, most recently at Apple, where he worked as a senior engineering manager on the company\\'s CoreMotion team, developing health and fitness features for the Apple Watch and iPhone.Mermel and Trietsch have a history of successful collaboration with Precision\\'s Co-Founder and Chief Science Officer, Ben Rapoport. Rapoport and Mermel met in the MD-PhD program at Harvard Medical school, where they both earned their medical degrees. Rapoport concurrently earned his PhD in electrical engineering from MIT; Mermel earned a PhD in cancer genomics from Harvard. (Rapoport specializes in neurosurgery, Memel in pathology.) While still graduate students, Rapoport and Mermel co-founded a company called Simbionics, which developed pioneering health software for wearable technology. Trietsch was their first software engineering hire. In 2014, Simbionics was acquired by a major technology company.Rapoport said that he was thrilled to be reuniting with Mermel and Trietsch. \"Craig\\'s and Dan\\'s skills are critical to Precision\\'s mission, because, as brain-computer interface technology becomes more sophisticated, data, machine learning, and software will become increasingly central to unlocking its full potential. In their years at companies such as Google and Apple, both Craig and Dan have learned how to create products that can scale to tens of millions of users, and this will be essential in building technology that, we hope, will create life-changing results for tens of millions of patients.\"Precision Neuroscience Corporation has offices in New York\\xa0and California, and seeks to expand its team in each location.For more information, visit precisionneuro.ioMedia InquiriesOtto Pohlotto@corecommunicationsconsulting.com+1.917.915.4400View original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/craig-mermel-and-dan-trietsch-join-precision-neuroscience-as-machine-learning-and-software-leads-301513226.htmlSOURCE  Precision Neuroscience CorporationThe above press release was provided courtesy of PRNewswire.

       " \"A rarely mentioned advantage of the current state of AI is that it's remarkably good at things that would take humans years to complete, like processing the entire canon of a certain literary or artistic movement or grokking the tonal structure of a certain genre of music. At the same time, some of AI's weak points — understanding complex contexts, acting in unpredictable or innovative ways and evaluating emotions or sensory inputs — are things humans excel at with little to no effort.\\xa0 Many uses of this technology may lie in new ways of collaborating with AI to accentuate what both biological and artificial intelligence do best.\\xa0 How can you be sure it isn't sentient?Simple, really: Information isn't knowledge. LLMs are kind of like having a reference librarian who can go beyond just pointing you to the right section of the library — she can quote you any line from any book in the library because she's read and memorized them all. But there's a problem. This seemingly perfect librarian has never done anything else but read everything in the library.Her lack of life experience makes it difficult for her to correctly interpret the contexts, subtexts, intentions and other less-than-literal nuances behind each word she ingested. What's worse: The same goes for her ability to correctly understand the questions and prompts she gets from library patrons. So she often gets things wrong.\\xa0It's as if the entirety of the written word was memorized by a single person ready to answer our questions about anything. The only catch is that the person also happens to be an alien.Plenty of users of ChatGPT have noticed frequent factual errors and inconsistencies in the responses the system gives. This is because it's trained on a wealth of data that hasn't been fact-checked and it doesn't fact-check itself, it just predicts what word should be next based on everything it's read. It literally has no common sense. This can lead to errors, something that CNET itself has experienced in using a generative AI model.\",\n",

       " \"\\xa0-\\xa0Dalet Digital Media Systems, a leading provider of solutions and services for broadcasters and content professionals, and Veritone® Inc. (NASDAQ: VERI), a leading provider of artificial intelligence (AI) insights and solutions, today announced a new collaboration. The new alliance will allow Dalet Galaxy customers to leverage Veritone’s industry-leading AI technology for automated metadata extraction and analysis, including speech-to-text transcription, face recognition, translation, object recognition, content moderation, logo recognition, and optical character recognition.\\xa0“Artificial Intelligence is one of our customers' top priorities. They recognize the power of AI to seamlessly and automatically process, transform and analyze data,”\\xa0noted Frederic Roux, vice president of sales, Americas at Dalet.\\xa0“We’re pleased to collaborate with Veritone in this effort to help media organizations capture new opportunities with smart workflow services that can easily become part of their existing installation.”The amount of multimedia content created and consumed is growing at an exponential pace in all verticals. As broadcasters and media organizations look at the best ways to tame the tsunami, streamline workflows and maximize the value of content, AI-enriched media management and workflow solutions will become a vital part for continued relevance and sustainable growth. Potential business benefits are immense and immediately tangible: augmented production workflows with smart and timely recommendations, better content insights and discovery thanks to intelligent auto-tagging features, automation of more complex tasks in the process and, in the near future, smart resource provisioning and system scaling with self-adaptive capacity planning.However, managing artificial intelligence at scale and fielding it in relevant use cases for media organizations require an advanced asset management and orchestration platform such as Dalet Galaxy. Leveraging on its flexible, media- and business-aware data model, as well as a fully featured integration framework, Dalet Galaxy offers a future-proof foundation to connect with Veritone's open, extensible ecosystem of AI engines and applications. By taking advantage of the Veritone Platform, Dalet Galaxy users will be able to search and exploit every frame of video and every second of audio for objects, faces, brands, text, sentiment, keywords and more.

       " ' /PRNewswire/ -- Crowdsourcing has become an increasingly popular way to develop machine learning algorithms to address many clinical problems in a variety of illnesses. Today at the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) annual meeting, a multicenter team led by an investigator from Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) presented the results from the RA2-DREAM Challenge, a crowdsourced effort focused on developing better methods to quantify joint damage in people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).HSS Logo (PRNewsfoto/Hospital for Special Surgery)Damage in the joints of people with RA is currently measured by visual inspection and detailed scoring on radiographic images\\xa0of small joints in the hands, wrists and feet. This includes both joint space narrowing (which indicates cartilage loss) and bone erosions (which indicates damage from invasion of the inflamed joint lining). The scoring system requires specially trained experts and is time-consuming and expensive. Finding an automated way to measure joint damage is important for both clinical research and for care of patients, according to the study\\'s senior author, S. Louis Bridges, Jr., MD, PhD, physician-in-chief and chair of the Department of Medicine at HSS.\"If a machine-learning approach could provide a quick, accurate quantitative score estimating the degree of joint damage in hands and feet, it would greatly help clinical research,\" he said. \"For example, researchers could analyze data from electronic health records and from genetic and other research assays to find biomarkers associated with progressive damage. Having to score all the images by visual inspection ourselves would be tedious, and outsourcing it is cost prohibitive.\"\"This approach could also aid rheumatologists by quickly assessing whether there is progression of damage over time, which would prompt a change in treatment to prevent further damage,\" he added. \"This is really important in geographic areas where expert musculoskeletal radiologists are not available.\"For the challenge, Dr. Bridges and his collaborators partnered with Sage Bionetworks, a nonprofit organization that helps investigators create DREAM (Dialogue on Reverse Engineering Assessment and Methods) Challenges. These competitions are focused on the development of innovative artificial intelligence-based tools in the life sciences. The investigators sent out a call for submissions, with grant money providing prizes for the winning teams. Competitors were from a variety of fields, including computer scientists, computational biologists and physician-scientists; none were radiologists with expertise or training in reading radiographic images.For the first part of the challenge, one set of images was provided to the teams, along with known scores that had been visually generated. These were used to train the algorithms. Additional sets of images were then provided so the competitors could test and refine the tools they had developed. In the final round, a third set of images was given without scores, and competitors estimated the amount of joint space narrowing and erosions. Submissions were judged according to which most closely replicated the gold-standard visually generated scores. There were 26 teams that submitted algorithms and 16 final submissions. In total, competitors were given 674 sets of images from 562 different RA patients, all of whom had participated in prior National Institutes of Health-funded research studies led by Dr. Bridges. In the end, four teams were named top performers.For the DREAM Challenge organizers, it was important that any scoring system developed through the project be freely available rather than proprietary, so that it could be used by investigators and clinicians at no cost. \"Part of the appeal of this collaboration was that everything is in the public domain,\" Dr. Bridges said.Dr. Bridges explained that additional research and development of computational methods are needed before the tools can be broadly used, but the current research demonstrates that this type of approach is feasible. \"We still need to refine the algorithms, but we\\'re much closer to our goal than we were before the Challenge,\" he concluded.About HSSHSS is the world\\'s leading academic medical center focused on musculoskeletal health. At its core is Hospital for Special Surgery, nationally ranked No. 1 in orthopedics (for the 12th consecutive year), No. 4 in rheumatology by U.S. News & World Report (2021-2022), and the best pediatric orthopedic hospital in NY, NJ and CT by U.S. News & World Report \"Best Children\\'s Hospitals\" list (2021-2022). HSS is ranked world #1 in orthopedics by Newsweek (2021-2022). Founded in 1863, the Hospital has the lowest complication and readmission rates in the nation for orthopedics, and among the lowest infection rates. HSS was the first in New York State to receive Magnet Recognition for Excellence in Nursing Service from the American Nurses Credentialing Center five consecutive times. The global standard total knee replacement was developed at HSS in 1969. An affiliate of Weill Cornell Medical College, HSS has a main campus in New York City and facilities in New Jersey, Connecticut and in the Long Island and Westchester County regions of New York State, as well as in Florida. In addition to patient care, HSS leads the field in research, innovation and education. The HSS Research Institute comprises 20 laboratories and 300 staff members focused on leading the advancement of musculoskeletal health through prevention of degeneration, tissue repair and tissue regeneration.

       " '\\xa0Source: Hall, Cox, Dickerson, Kannan, Kulkarni, and Schmidt[34]The modeler built ten models that reduced the level of disparate impact. Of those, two increased on prior levels of model quality (predictive power of default) and only one demonstrated a reduction in model quality of more than five percentage points. One conclusion would be adopting any model that could achieve an improvement in both criteria. Alternatively, regulators could lend support for improvements in fairness that resulted in only minimal concessions to model quality.We contend that the Agencies should commit to the latter approach. Such a system would require the Agencies to indicate what level of unfairness triggers a need for a new model. A post-processing measure, such as an adverse impact ratio, would provide clarity. Subsequently, the Agencies should indicate a minimum standard for fairness and appropriate ratios for improvements in fairness relative to losses in model quality.c) Provide guidance on how financial institutions should test their algorithmic underwriting models to mitigate against biases against protected class members.Methods for mitigating bias in AI/ML models take one of three general forms: pre-process, where disparities in training data are addressed; in-process, where algorithms are trained to remove disparities while “learning;” and post-process, where models are altered in response to observed outcomes.Pre-processing approaches consider the training data set used by the modeler. For the context of protecting against discriminatory outcomes, pre-processing can avoid situations where the data used to build a model is incomplete, not representative of the broader population, or if it is inconsistent with real-world contexts. If such procedures are not implemented, then a “garbage-in garbage-out” problem may occur. An AI/ML model is only as good as its data.The agencies can implement methods to safeguard against overfitting by creating a publicly maintained data set for testing. While compliance efforts have tended to focus on outcomes,[35]\\xa0an emphasis on pre-processing techniques has its own merits.In-processing techniques consist of interventions made during the training period of model building. Adversarial debiasing allows a modeler to see which attributes contribute the most to unfairness and then change the model’s weightings to optimize for fairness.[36]A virtue of pre-processing and in-processing techniques is that lenders can conduct these efforts before introducing a model to the marketplace.Post-processing approaches rely on means for measuring bias in completed models. “Drop-one” systems, where variables are removed iteratively to see their “marginal effect” on a fairness criterion, are an example of a post-processing approach. Others may involve re-construction of an algorithm rarely than merely the “drop” of one variable. Post-processing techniques can identify sources of discrimination and measure the impact of a change in a model to fairness, accuracy, or other criteria.AIRs and standardized mean differences do not suggest specific changes, but they can measure disparate impact in a model. Although they do bear the virtue of simplicity, post-process approaches can lead to sub-optimal resolutions. These approaches can be used to create comparisons between “unfair” and “fair” models, which could then become the basis for some lenders to assert that fairness is costly, or alternatively to make it satisfactory to stop at a “slightly less unfair” model as opposed to re-iterating to a fair one.Post-processing techniques are relatively simple to implement. From a regulatory perspective, they have value because they allow an agency to make a judgment about a system without stipulating how it should be changed. Nonetheless, the best way to simplify a model is not through post-processing but instead by beginning with an explainable training data set and model.d) State that lenders are responsible for algorithms and predictive models that have a disparate impact on members of protected classes, even if they are created or maintained by third parties. State that lenders should conduct their model risk assessments using independent sources.Agencies should encourage lenders to conduct periodic audits of their training data sets and models.e) Provide guidance on the collection and analysis of demographic data for self-testing privileges.Efforts by lenders to conduct self-testing for compliance with fair lending rules confront challenges due to a lack of clarity from the Agencies on collecting demographic data. At the moment, mortgage lenders must collect and report data on aspects of demographic data under Regulation C implementing the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and a similar requirement is expected to be implemented for the collection of small business lending data pursuant to Section 1071 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. However, Regulation B is not clear on when and for what purposes lenders can collect data when offering other types of credit products.[37]As a result, compliance professionals use statistical methods to approximate the demographic makeup of their customers. In 2014, the CFPB published a report on the effectiveness of the Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) proxy method, noting that it presented improvements over previous approaches that only used surnames or geocoding.[38]Nonetheless, BISG still has certain shortcomings. Most notably, while compliance professionals can use BISG to estimate the overall demographic makeup of a group of applicants, they cannot have certainty over the demographic identity of individual applicants. Moreover, given that rates of inter-racial marriage are increasing, the predictive power of the surnames in BISG may decrease. The same concerns exist for geocoding in areas with high rates of gentrification. As well, the predictive power of any BISG analysis faces constraints with smaller sample sizes. Despite these limitations, BISG is accepted by both regulators and responsible lenders as a diagnostic tool to proxy for race and ethnicity because it is reasonably accurate.Lenders should continue to enhance their proxy methodologies through the use of self-testing. To facilitate improvements and simplify the process, lenders could benefit from considering demographic data to assist with their internal fair lending compliance procedures. However, they often hesitate to do so for fear of exposing their organizations to additional compliance risk. We believe that lenders could benefit from new guidance that clarifies the extent to which they can use demographic data for self-testing, as long as that data is not included in marketing, underwriting, servicing, fraud protection, or other credit-related decisions.In addition, please see part B of our response to Questions 4 and 5.ConclusionNCRC applauds the decision by the Agencies to address the use of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and alternative data.NCRC believes that future supervision, rulemaking, and enforcement of AI and ML should focus on the principles of equity, transparency, and accountability.Our comments have focused on concerns related to the explainability of models, accountability, the use of alternative data, and the need to build safeguards to prevent discriminatory practices.NCRC urges the Agencies to ensure that the use of AI and ML develops in ways that are non-discriminatory.\\xa0\\xa0As the use of these technologies becomes increasingly widespread, urgency will build for regulators to establish safeguards. The Agencies must address these questions as soon as possible, as we face an inflection point where algorithmic underwriting may develop in ways that either add to or undermine access to fair, safe, and inclusive financial services.We encourage the Agencies to provide guidance on how financial institutions should deploy artificial intelligence and machine learning. If the Agencies can give clear guidance on the issues outlined in our comment, it will clarify that well-intentioned actors need to build and market safe products. Indeed, without substantial changes, lenders will be unable to adequately explain adverse decisions or establish compliance systems that empower the kinds of frequent self-testing efforts that machine learning requires.To reduce the chance of digital redlining, the Agencies should insist that all lenders build explainable models. Explainable models create safeguards against digital redlining.Financial service regulators should hold all lenders accountable for testing their models for disparate impact, including those using alternative data developed by the lender or purchased from a third party.\\xa0\\xa0We encourage the Agencies to provide guidance on how and when lenders should implement alternatives.Making a commitment to equity must include explicitly identifying discriminatory practices as a type of risk, by providing guidance on the disparate impact standard by updating the language to state that the creditor practice must meet a “substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interest, and by emphasizing diversity in hiring.Please contact me, Brad Blower (bblower@ncrc.org), or Adam Rust (arust@ncrc.org) if we can provide clarity on any of these issues or others.Sincerely,National Community Reinvestment CoalitionAffordable Homeownership Foundation, Inc.California Reinvestment CoalitionCASA of OregonClarifiCommunity Service NetworkEducationalFair Finance WatchFair Housing Center of Central IndianaHOME of Greater CincinnatiHousing Justice CenterHousing on MeritLINC UPMakingChange, IncMaryland Consumer Rights CoalitionMetro North Community Development Corp.National Association of American Veterans, Inc.Northwest Indiana Reinvestment AllianceOlive Hill Community Economic Development Corporation, IncPeople’s Self-Help HousingPublic Good Law CenterSouthern Dallas Progress Community Development CorporationStark County Minority Business AssociationUnited South Broadway CorporationAPPENDIX:Statement on Request for Guidance on Implementation of Disparate Impact Rules under ECOAA proposal by National Community Reinvestment Coalition’s Innovation Council for Financial Inclusion.Preventing discrimination in the use of algorithms and predictive models is crucial for a fair financial system in the digital age. As a group of both consumer advocates and financial services companies, we have found a shared interest in encouraging a fair lending regulatory framework that can truly address the risk of digital discrimination, while also promoting technology and data innovation that has the potential to increase financial inclusion and lower prices for consumers. We believe the avoidance of disparate impact is the core of the solution.We appreciate disparate impact’s statistical, outcomes-based approach to identifying discrimination. By assessing outcomes, rather than inputs, disparate impact addresses discrimination that can arise when decisions are the result of algorithms or data, rather than human intent.\\xa0\\xa0We also believe this outcomes-based approach establishes disparate impact as a pro-innovation framework for preventing discrimination.\\xa0\\xa0This is because it can accommodate advances in credit modeling, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and alternative data, which have the potential to increase financial inclusion, while at the same time holding these technologies accountable for addressing potential discriminatory impact.\\xa0\\xa0This combination of innovation and outcomes-based accountability will produce the most fair, inclusive, consumer friendly financial services ecosystem, and allow innovation\\xa0to\\xa0help address the “financial services deserts” by bringing the benefits of the financial system to those who are currently underserved.We ask that the CFPB update its guidance on disparate impact to reinforce the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) and Regulation B, for the digital age, in a manner that is designed to encourage a fair, innovative and more inclusive financial system. We believe the need for updated guidance is even greater as a result of HUD’s 2020 Disparate Impact Rule.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0HUD’s rule, currently enjoined in federal court, undermines the disparate impact framework when used under the Fair Housing Act, and if followed could become a misguided template for regulation of disparate impact under ECOA,To encourage innovation and financial inclusion, the CFPB should provide further guidance on disparate impact under ECOA and Regulation B by:Specifically stating that the disparate impact framework applies to both traditional and technological underwriting techniques, including those that use artificial intelligence, machine learning, algorithms, and the use of alternative data.Aligning the “legitimate business need” standard to the 2013 HUD rule.We call on the CFPB to update Regulation B and its Commentary to establish that a creditor practice must meet a “substantial, legitimate, and non-discriminatory interest” that cannot reasonably be achieved through another practice that has a less discriminatory effect.\\xa0\\xa0This clarification is important to reduce uncertainty about what constitutes a “legitimate business need” and to minimize the risk that a lender could assert that greater profit alone is a sufficient business justification without considering the harm caused from disparate impact. We suggest the CFPB also provide examples of how lenders can demonstrate legitimate business need.Establishing statistical standards of “practical significance” to clarify when disparities would rise to the level of potentially constituting grounds for a disparate impact discrimination claim. This would increase accountability while providing clarity and ease of administration for responsible compliance programs. Such clarity could have the added benefit of giving lenders the freedom to further innovate their lending.d) Clarifying how lenders may deploy alternativeanalyses to search for less-discriminatory alternatives to a practice or data variable found to result in a disparity. Guidelines should addresswhen\\xa0and\\xa0how\\xa0a review for a less-discriminatory alternative is appropriate, and the extent that a guidance could include use case-specific models for defensible practices.e) Providing additional guidance on the use of the self-testing privilege to gather data on customer race, ethnicity, or gender, and the useof self-testing, including methods other than BISG.This guidance would provide more regulatory certainty in loan product types beyond mortgage lending. With additional clarity from the Bureau, more lenders could implement robust self-testing and remediation protocols.We believe that the above guidance will foster more effective monitoring of disparate impact in compliance with ECOA, while also providing greater access to affordable credit.[1]\\xa012 C.F.R. pt. 1002, Supp. I, ¶ 1002.2(p)–4[2]\\xa0The group includes the National Fair Housing Alliance, Fair Play AI, ACLU, Lawyer’s Committee, Upturn, AI Blindspot, FinRegLab, Tech Equity Collaborative, BLDS, and Relman Colfax.[3]\\xa0The members of NCRC’s Innovation Council are Affirm, Lending Club, PayPal, Square, Oportun, and Varo.[4]\\xa0FICO. “The State of Responsible AI.” FICO, ',\n",

The current record is held by a two-story office building in Dubai, which stands 6 metres high.However, the paper said the Yangqu dam will be 180 metres high.At Yangqu, a central AI system will be used to oversee a massive automated assembly line that starts with a fleet of unmanned trucks used to transport construction materials to parts of the worksite, per the scientists.Once the materials arrive, unmanned bulldozers and pavers will turn them into a layer of the dam, and then rollers equipped with sensors will help to press each layer so that they become firm and durable, they said.Per the paper, when a layer is complete, the robots will send information about the state of construction back to the AI system.However, the mining of the construction material will still have to be done manually, the researchers noted.The AI system and its army of robots will help eliminate human error, such as when roller operators don't keep to a straight line or when truck drivers deliver materials to the wrong spot, said lead author Liu Tianyun of Tsinghua University, according to SCMP.The system will also allow on-site work to progress continuously without safety concerns for human workers, the researchers said, per the outlet.According to the scientists, the completed Yangqu dam will provide 5 billion kilowatt-hours of power every year to China.If successful, the building method could provide a blueprint for other construction projects, such as road construction, Liu's team said, as reported by SCMP.China, which is facing a plummeting birth rate and possible labour shortages, has in recent years turned to automation to keep its industries going.Get the best of our site\\xa0emailed to you every weekday.Go to\\xa0the Business Insider front page\\xa0for more stories.\",\n",

We’re trying to look at underage talent, talent from the extremities of the country, people that potentially aren’t in teams already,\" he said.“The players we’re looking at might be a year away from actually being a part of the RCB.

The company has leveraged Azure Speech Services and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to simplify the insurance requirements of its customers, including purchase of new policies, renewal of existing policies, and settlement of claims. The deployment of Azure AI tools has enabled ICICI Lombard to increase the accuracy of Quality Audit (QA) during its calls – from 50% to over 80%. It has also enhanced the efficiency of its internal audit process by reducing latency from 12 hours to two hours, apart from increasing productivity of its call center agents.The ICICI Lombard digital team currently makes over 1,000 outbound customer calls daily through its call center. While the company screened and audited calls randomly to check compliance levels and quality of its tele-customer service, the high call volume was affecting efficacy of audits. It is important to evaluate adherence to approved scripts and use of appropriate tonality by agents during customer calls, as is reporting non-compliance within 24 hours. Multiplicity of language is another challenge, with customers often switching between English and Hindi during calls. Moreover, owing to the diversity of dialects across the country, ensuring clarity of accent is a concern as well.To address these issues, ICICI Lombard’s data scientists collaborated with Microsoft’s AI team to implement Azure Speech Services and create a customized NLP algorithm. This has allowed the insurance provider to screen 100% of its calls now as against 20% earlier. It was also able to automate its Quality Assurance process to remove human bias from customer calls, resulting in improved customer outreach, increased productivity and consistency across the audit system. Further, the tools easily process customer queries in Hindi and English and detect insurance-specific keywords easily.Girish Nayak, Chief of Customer Service, Operations and Technology, ICICI Lombard, said “Given the diversity of our customer ecosystem and dynamic requirements, it was important to facilitate a seamless policy buying and claim experience. Today, customer engagement requires a focused, customized and agile approach to address queries and issues.

       " '  Twitter and Google’s YouTube were among the big tech companies to announce Monday that their artificial intelligence tools will now be taking on more responsibility for content moderation due to social distancing. “We’re working to improve our tech,” Twitter noted in a statement, adding that “this might result in some mistakes.” Big tech companies\\xa0often blame\\xa0artificial intelligence system for mistakenly nixing or impacting user content that does not in any way violate Twitter’s policies. Twitter, for instance, suggested in April 2019 that the auto system was partially to blame for the suspension of a pro-life group. “When an account violates the Twitter Rules, the system looks for linked accounts to mitigate things like ban evasion,” a company spokeswoman told the Daily Caller News Foundation in April 2019. “In this case, the account was mistakenly caught in our automated systems for ban evasion.”  The spokeswoman was referring to an account called “Unplanned,” which promoted a movie about a former abortion clinic director who became pro-life. The system is designed to suspend so-called sock-puppet accounts connected to a profile that violated company policies, according to the spokeswoman.

       " \",3 min ReadIs it possible to start a deep tech startup without a tech background?\\xa0“Absolutely,” said Amritagandha Dutta, Founder and CEO of Expand AI at YourStory's Mumbai edition of TechSparks 2023.At its core, entrepreneurship is about problem solving. Quick research will reveal that Airbnb, Tinder, Pandora, and Alibaba are all great examples of tech startups built by non-tech founders. The truth is that the best startups around the world are formed at a focal point of two or more domains.From taking AI courses on Coursera to interviewing ML engineers, Amritagandha had to buckle down from the get-go since she’s from a non-tech background.“I went to TiECON Mumbai and Startup Grind in Silicon Valley. After speaking to many leaders I realised that automating the data annotation process to solve the data bottleneck in the AI space would be an intrepid problem to solve,” she said.Data annotation is essential for businesses because it enables them to train machine learning models that can automate tasks and improve decision-making.\\xa0Dutta reveals how she felt while showcasing her demo. “The moment I see that spark on the face of ML engineers when we give them a live demo of our software, I know it’s worth it.”She said in comparison to manual data labelling, the industry standard for data annotation, Expand AI gives 95% accurate labels. “We've reduced the time by at least 70%, and the cost by up to 50%, along with ensuring 100% data privacy.”Apart from solving this bottleneck in the AI space, Dutta is also helping democratise AI with TheHumanityPledge Foundation.\\xa0This is important because the democratisation of AI enables more people to benefit from this technology, by promoting diversity and inclusivity within the AI community. By working together to achieve this goal, companies can create a future in which AI is a force for good.Dutta said TheHumanityPedge Foundation is essentially an accelerator. “We're investing in AI as well as clean tech companies.”Working with a deeptech startupExpand AI is a small team with “audacious goals” and each of them is working to actualise their vision.Dutta talked about the one thing that anyone wishing to work in deeptech should do. “Learn to build positive relationships. That's actually crucial during the hiring process. You never know when you're going to need them. And it's not just with tech folks, but with anybody,” she said.The founder said emotional intelligence, along with IQ, is key in such a scenario. The relationships and the trust you build “will help you be an AI entrepreneur, even if you’re from a non-tech background”.“To me, it's about creating the world of tomorrow,” Dutta said.\\xa0TechSparks MumbaiExpand AIDeepTechStartup EcosystemShare onTrending NowTrending StoriesInitial IPL TV viewership gives confidence and validation of strategy, says Disney StarMagenta Mobility, Lightmetrics, Apptile, Ossus Biorenewables raise funding\",\n",
       " 'Gmail will get some AI functionality, Google parent company Alphabet said Thursday. Igor Golovniov/Getty Images Google announced plans to add more AI features and improvements to its products.It\\'s been developing AI models for years and has used AI in products, including search.It also plans to release its AI applications to the public for feedback and further experimentation.For more stories, go to www.BusinessInsider.co.za.Google– which, in its earnings call, bragged that it\\'s the company responsible for today\\'s generative AI craze – laid out plans to integrate more of the technology into a majority of its products, including Gmail.Google faces some threat to its standing as the No. 1 search engine after Microsoft – which runs the extremely distant second place Bing —\\xa0will incorporate ChatGPT. Microsoft is an investor in ChatGPT parent OpenAI.To be clear, Google has been using and doing research on AI for several years, even before ChatGPT was a twinkle in the eye of its developers. But the rise of ChatGPT — built by former Googlers — pushed the search giant into a corner.It needs to prove it will bring its powerful AI models, like the large language model LaMDA, to its products and make the models more open for developers to use. Large language models power ChatGPT.And so Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced AI will be coming to Gmail and Docs. Pichai held off on explaining exactly what generative AI in emails would look like. But in broad strokes, he said the plan is to make AI capabilities available \"in design and more.\"\\xa0Google will release new tools and APIs for developers and users to experiment with its AI models. Unlike some Big Tech AI models, ChatGPT went insanely viral because it was so easy to use and available even to non-programmers. LaMDA, Pichai said, will be made available \"in the coming weeks and months\" so others can interact with it and provide feedback.The company also announced plans to offer more AI products for businesses and organisations, though Pichai did not specify which kinds.\\xa0Pichai emphasised the role AI plays in Google\\'s past, present, and future. He said AI is the most profound thing the company is working on.\"Translating these kinds of technical leaps into products that help billions of people is what our company has always strived on,\" Pichai said. \"We\\'ll pursue this work boldly but with a deep sense of responsibility.\"Pichai pointed to using AI to improve Google Search and said people should expect further upgrades fueled by AI. These new features on search will also allow people to interact with the company\\'s large language models \"in experimental and innovative ways.\"\\xa0But adding generative AI to your email client is not the endpoint for Google. Instead, the company wants to use AI to cut its costs.Coming at the heels of laying off 12,000 employees, Google and Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat said the company plans to improve the efficiency of its tech infrastructure using AI, a move that usually means a company wants to automate more of its workflow.\\xa0Google will release more details about its plans to bring more AI to its popular products, but for now, you can wait a bit longer before sending that AI-written email.',\n",

       " \", 8:36 p.m.·3 min readWASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden said Tuesday it remains to be seen if artificial intelligence is dangerous, but that he believes technology companies must ensure their products are safe before releasing them to the public.Biden met with his council of advisers on science and technology about the risks and opportunities that rapid advancements in artificial intelligence pose for individual users and national security.“AI can help deal with some very difficult challenges like disease and climate change, but it also has to address the potential risks to our society, to our economy, to our national security,” Biden told the group, which includes academics as well as executives from Microsoft and Google.Artificial intelligence burst to the forefront in the national and global conversation in recent months after the release of the popular ChatGPT AI chatbot, which helped spark a race among tech giants to unveil similar tools, while raising ethical and societal concerns about technology that can generate convincing prose or imagery that looks like it's the work of humans.While tech companies should always be responsible for the safety of their products, Biden's reminder reflects something new — the emergence of easy-to-use AI tools that can generate manipulative content and realistic-looking synthetic media known as deepfakes, said Rebecca Finley, CEO of the industry-backed Partnership on AI.The White House said the Democratic president was using the AI meeting to “discuss the importance of protecting rights and safety to ensure responsible innovation and appropriate safeguards” and to reiterate his call for Congress to pass legislation to protect children and curtail data collection by technology companies.Italy last week temporarily blocked ChatGPT over data privacy concerns, and European Union lawmakers have been negotiating the passage of new rules to limit high-risk AI products across the 27-nation bloc.By contrast, “the U.S. has had more a laissez-faire approach to the commercial development of AI,” said Russell Wald, managing director of policy and society at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence.Story continuesBiden's Tuesday remarks won't likely change that, but Biden “is setting the stage for a national dialogue on the topic by elevating attention to AI, which is desperately needed,” Wald said.The Biden administration last year unveiled a set of far-reaching goals aimed at averting harms caused by the rise of AI systems, including guidelines for how to protect people’s personal data and limit surveillance.The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights notably did not set out specific enforcement actions, but instead was intended as a call to action for the U.S. government to safeguard digital and civil rights in an AI-fueled world.Biden's council, known as PCAST, is composed of science, engineering, technology and medical experts and is co-chaired by the Cabinet-ranked director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, Arati Prabhakar.Asked if AI is dangerous, Biden said Tuesday, “It remains to be seen. Could be.”—————AP writers Chris Megerian and Matt O'Brien contributed to this report.Zeke Miller, The Associated Press\",\n",

Senior Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala has accused the government of corruption in awarding contracts and sub-deals to procure and install the equipment, resulting in a cost escalation of the project. He alleges that Keltron, the state PSU contracted for the project, awarded the contract to Bengaluru-based SRIT India Pvt Ltd in violation of tender norms. In response, Keltron denies any wrongdoing and denies involvement in awarding sub-contracts. State Transport Minister Antony Raju has asked Keltron to answer Chennithala’s allegations. Chennithala claims that the whole deal for Rs 232 crore was more than three times the sum first projected by the companies. He also alleges that the cameras were only ANPR cameras and not AI-based as claimed by the government. He said if the government does not disclose the details of the initiative and why the cost went up, ‘I will release all the details’.    ‘In this, Light Master withdrew from the contract. None of the companies has any previous experience in the said work. Government is looting the public money by keeping the PSU as a front,’ Chennithala alleges. He said that the government inked a deal with Keltron in 2020 to set up a fully automated traffic enforcement system. ‘Rs 151.22 crore has been allocated for this purpose. Did other companies participate in the tender? Has the contract been awarded following the tender criteria? Keltron should answer these questions,’ Chennithala said.

       " \" 7:00 AMGet Ready to Meet the ChatGPT ClonesThe technology behind OpenAI’s viral chatbot is set to become widely replicated, unleashing a tidal wave of bots.FacebookTwitterEmailSave StoryFacebookTwitterEmailSave StoryChatGPT might well be the most famous, and\\xa0potentially valuable, algorithm of the moment, but the\\xa0artificial intelligence techniques used by\\xa0OpenAI to provide its smarts are neither unique nor secret. Competing projects and open-source clones may soon make ChatGPT-style bots available for anyone to copy and reuse.Stability AI, a startup that has already developed and open-sourced advanced image-generation technology, is working on an open competitor to ChatGPT. “We are a few months from release,” says Emad Mostaque, Stability’s CEO. A number of competing startups, including\\xa0Anthropic,\\xa0Cohere, and\\xa0AI21, are working on proprietary chatbots similar to OpenAI’s bot.The impending flood of sophisticated chatbots will make the technology more abundant and visible to consumers, as well as more accessible to AI businesses, developers, and researchers. That could accelerate the rush to make money with AI tools that generate images, code, and text.Established companies like Microsoft and Slack are incorporating ChatGPT\\xa0into their products, and many startups are hustling to build on top of\\xa0a new ChatGPT API for developers. But wider availability of the technology may also complicate efforts to predict and\\xa0mitigate the risks that come with it.\\xa0ChatGPT’s beguiling ability to provide convincing answers to a wide range of queries also causes it to sometimes\\xa0make up facts or adopt problematic personas. It can help out with malicious tasks such as producing malware code, or spam and disinformation campaigns.As a result,\\xa0some researchers have called for deployment of ChatGPT-like systems to be slowed while the risks are assessed. “There is no need to stop research, but we certainly could regulate widespread deployment,” says Gary Marcus, an AI expert who has sought to draw attention to risks such as disinformation generated by AI. “We might, for example, ask for studies on 100,000 people before releasing these technologies to 100 millions of people.”\\xa0Wider availability of ChatGPT-style systems, and release of open-source versions, would make it more difficult to limit research or wider deployment. And the competition between companies large and small to adopt or match ChatGPT suggests little appetite for slowing down, but appears instead to incentivize proliferation of the technology.Last week, LLaMA, an AI model developed by Meta—and similar to the one at the core of ChatGPT—was leaked online after being shared with some academic researchers. The system could be used as a building block in the creation of a chatbot, and its release\\xa0sparked worry among those who fear that the AI systems known as large language models, and chatbots built on them like ChatGPT, will be used to generate misinformation or automate cybersecurity breaches. Some experts argue that\\xa0such risks may be overblown, and others suggest that making the technology more transparent\\xa0will in fact help others guard against misuses.\\xa0\\xa0Meta declined to answer questions about the leak, but company spokesperson Ashley Gabriel provided a statement saying, “While the model is not accessible to all, and some have tried to circumvent the approval process, we believe the current release strategy allows us to balance responsibility and openness.”Most PopularSecurityThe FBI Just Admitted It Bought US Location DataDell CameronBusinessThe Alarming Rise of India’s Pay-to-Breathe IndustryAkanksha SinghCultureThe 10 Best Shows on HBO Max Right NowWiredBusinessWhy the Floppy Disk Just Won’t DieJacopo PriscoChatGPT is built on top of text-generation technology that has been\\xa0available for several years and learns to mirror human text by picking up on patterns in enormous quantities of text, much of it scraped from the web. OpenAI found that adding a chat interface and providing an additional layer of machine learning that involved humans providing feedback on the bot’s responses made the technology more capable and articulate.The data provided by users interacting with ChatGPT, or services built on it such as\\xa0Microsoft’s new Bing search interface, may provide OpenAI a key advantage. But other companies are working on replicating the fine-tuning that created ChatGPT.Stability AI is currently funding a project investigating how to train similar chatbots called\\xa0Carper AI. Alexandr Wang, CEO of\\xa0Scale AI, a startup that carries out data labeling and machine-learning training for many technology companies, says many customers are asking for help doing fine-tuning similar to what OpenAI did to create ChatGPT. “We’re pretty overwhelmed with demand,” he says.Wang believes that the efforts already underway will naturally mean many more capable language models and chatbots emerging. “I think there will be a vibrant ecosystem,” he says.Sean Gourley, CEO of Primer, a startup that sells AI tools for intelligence analysts, including those in the US government, and an adviser to Stability AI, also expects to soon see many projects make systems like ChatGPT. “The watercooler talk is that this took about 20,000 hours of training,” he says of the human feedback process that honed OpenAI’s bot.Gourley estimates that even a project that involved several times as much training would cost a few million dollars—affordable to a well-funded startup or large technology company. “It's a magical breakthrough,” Gourley says of the fine-tuning that OpenAI did with ChatGPT. “But it's not something that isn't going to be replicated.”What happened after OpenAI announced\\xa0DALL-E 2, a tool for generating complex, aesthetically pleasing images from a text prompt in April 2022 may foreshadow the path ahead for ChatGPT-like bots.OpenAI implemented safeguards on its image generator to prevent users from making sexually explicit or violent images, or ones featuring recognizable faces, and only made the tool available to a limited number of artists and researchers for fear that it might be abused. Yet because the techniques behind DALL-E were well known among AI researchers, similar AI art tools soon appeared. Four months after DALL-E 2 was released, Stability AI released an open-source image generator called Stable Diffusion that has been folded into numerous products but also adapted\\xa0to generate images prohibited by OpenAI.Clement Delangue, CEO of\\xa0Hugging Face, a company that hosts open-source AI projects, including some developed by Stability AI, believes it will be possible to replicate ChatGPT, but he doesn’t want to predict when.\\xa0“Nobody knows, and we’re still at the learning phase,” he says. “You never really know that you have a good model before you have a good model,” he says. “Could be next week, could be next year.” Neither is very far off.More Great WIRED Stories📩 The latest on tech, science, and more: Get our newsletters!The mining industry’s next frontier is in the deep seaAre customizable game controllers worth it?As Kenya’s crops fail, a fight over GMOs ragesThe debate on deepfake porn misses the pointHow WIRED will use generative AI tools👁️ Explore AI like never before with our new database✨ Optimize your home life with our Gear team’s best picks, from robot vacuums to affordable mattresses to smart speakersWill Knight is a senior writer for WIRED, covering artificial intelligence.

All of it has started to make more sense since its creator announced on Wednesday that a paid subscription version will be launched in the United States.\\xa0It is entirely possible that November’s release of ChatGPT by California company OpenAI will be remembered as a turning point in introducing a new wave of artificial intelligence to the wider public.So far, over a million users have tested the potential and limits of ChatGPT – a chatbot developed by AI research company OpenAI – to write emails, poems, or code, or even produce entire research papers. The chatbot recently passed a Wharton School MBA exam, prompting further admiration and alarm.Several academic journal publishers have banned authors from using ChatGPT, and professors are changing exams and assignments in response to the tool.While many of us are stunned by how impressive and natural the output can be, it doesn’t mean it’s useful for everything we do. Here’s what we’ve found are the major implications for research, teaching, and learning.When it comes to assignments with open-ended components, I have started to ask students to submit the ChatGPT response to the theme they picked and include an appendix telling me how they used it.\\xa0I can’t be in the business of policing whether they use it or not, and this is a tool they need to learn how to use (my views would be different if I was teaching younger students – high schoolers for instance). I tell them they should worry less about ChatGPT making them redundant and more about being made redundant by somebody who can effectively use such technologies.\\xa0\\xa0ChatGPT seems to have three goals: Be helpful, be truthful, and be inoffensive. However, in its attempt to be helpful (and inoffensive), it occasionally makes stuff up. When it tries to be helpful and truthful, it can say things that are offensive. Will OpenAI’s reinforcement learning with human feedback catch and correct this?\\xa0Punishing unhelpful answers may push the AI to give false answers; punishing false answers may make it give offensive ones; and punishing offensive answers may make it give unhelpful ones. OpenAI needs to grapple with this impossible trinity.ChatGPT can be useful for compression, such as providing summaries of articles, emails, and books, but only if users apply critical thinking to weed out misinformation. It can also help generate “alternative perspectives” to understand how various groups of people perceive things such as product descriptions, political statements, mission statements, or the news. For example, you could ask ChatGPT for an ambitious, complimentary, cynical, or culture-specific summary of a piece of text as a way to discover new ways of thinking, raise new questions, and also improve the original text.\\xa0This has implications for our education system. Instead of answering questions, students of the future might be asked to write 10 questions for AI and assess its answers based on the different versions and perspectives requested. In this sense, AI may indeed prove valuable for education much like the printing press was. “Supercreativity” – a concept we outlined a few years ago – is around the corner. In the words of Sebastian Thrun, the academic, entrepreneur, and founder of Google X: “We have not even begun to understand how creative AI will become. If you take all the world’s knowledge and creativity and put it into a bottle, you will be amazed by what will come out of it.”By using ChatGPT to generate multiple texts on a topic, one can also distinguish that volume of text from those written by humans to identify possible differences and potential gaps for research. This ability to work together with AI to create better content, ideas, and innovations will become increasingly important.\\xa0Going forward, we also need to develop innovative and strong processes for humans to work together with machines and oversee AI to ensure what it generates or does is safe and trustworthy.Read More:PTA Criticizes Wikipedia For Not Removing “Blasphemous Content”\\xa00share Facebook Twitter LinkedIn WhatsApp Gmail Written by  Muhammad Muneeb Ur RehmanMuneeb is a full-time  News/Tech writer at TechJuice.pk.

       " ' /PRNewswire/ -- Darktrace, a global leader in cyber security artificial intelligence, today announced the launch of Darktrace PREVENT, an interconnected set of AI products that deliver a proactive cyber security capability to help organizations pre-empt future cyber-attacks. Darktrace PREVENT is the third product area in Darktrace\\'s delivery of a Cyber AI Loop, the industry-first set of AI capabilities which work together autonomously to optimize an organization\\'s state of security through a continuous feedback loop.The new Darktrace PREVENT product family is based on breakthroughs developed in the firm\\'s Cambridge Cyber AI Research Centre and the capabilities gained through the acquisition of Cybersprint in March 2022. PREVENT uses AI to \\'think like an attacker,\\' finding pathways to an organization\\'s most critical assets from inside and outside. Underpinned by AI that \\'knows you,\\' it continuously analyzes the most disruptive attacks for an organization and feeds that information back into DETECT and RESPOND to support continuous learning and automation to harden systems.A number of organizations in the US, UK and Northern Europe are early adopters of Darktrace PREVENT products, including the City of Las Vegas and Sedgwick, a leading global provider of technology-enabled risk, benefits and integrated business solutions.Commenting on the PREVENT product, Michael Lee Sherwood, Chief Innovation Officer, City of Las Vegas, said:\"Our team is finding Darktrace PREVENT very useful as it provides the types of insights and reflections we need to ensure we maintain a level of transparency and validity within our digital environment. I can see lots of ROI for municipal environments, especially those built-in cloud and virtual environments, use cases for external auditing, visibility into IoT environments, continuous pen testing, and actively monitoring risk. It also addresses some of the skilled analyst shortages that the cyber security industry is facing.\"Eric Schmitt, Global Chief Information Security Officer at Sedgwick, commented:\"Darktrace PREVENT pairs up our inside and outside views and integrates them with DETECT and RESPOND, which is a game changer. Our customers are advocating that we need to be continuously testing the efficacy of our security. Darktrace PREVENT does just that.\"Darktrace\\'s latest product family is set to proactively defend organizations against the heightened volume and sophistication of cyber threats, which is making identification and prioritization of their most pressing vulnerabilities increasingly difficult. In new data published today, Darktrace reveals that high-priority attempts to breach customer systems increased by 49% globally between January and June 2022. Over the same period, Darktrace saw a 138% increase in attempted cyber-attacks targeting customers in government-related sectors globally. In the month of June, the Information and Communication sector was the most highly targeted across Darktrace\\'s global customer base as it was in the US. In the UK, the most targeted industry was the public sector and government-related sectors. At the same time, security teams are contending with an ever-increasing volume of vulnerabilities, and they do not have the resources to fight on all fronts. With the launch of PREVENT, Darktrace provides more predictive and preventative solutions to tackle cyber threats and business risk - rather than waiting for breaches to occur before action is taken. In new data published today, based on external vulnerability data of over 150 organizations, Darktrace reveals that 85% of high-risk vulnerabilities are not patched within one week and 70% are still unpatched after one month. Defenders do not have the resources to fight on every front and they cannot simply be reactive anymore.Commenting on the launch of Darktrace PREVENT, Poppy Gustafsson OBE, CEO at Darktrace, said:\"Organizations don\\'t have bottomless budgets and security teams don\\'t have endless time. By helping human teams to get a much better picture of their security vulnerabilities and by prioritizing the areas that need hardening first so they can protect their most critical assets, we hope we can help our customers to free themselves of cyber disruption. I\\'m so excited about today\\'s launch of our PREVENT products, which is a major milestone for Darktrace and brings us one step closer to fulfilling our vision of a Cyber AI Loop.\"Chris Kissel, Research Director at the International Data Corporation (IDC), the premier global provider of market intelligence for the IT, telecommunications and consumer technology markets said:\"A purely reactive approach to security is quickly becoming inadequate. Early data from research into how organizations are mitigating cyber risk and threats show a shift towards proactive, \\'always-on\\' technologies continually running tests on existing systems. Yet a continuous approach is fundamentally impossible to achieve without automation and AI, and Darktrace\\'s combination of AI technology that learns self and its new PREVENT product family will bring real value to thinly stretched security teams.\"Notes to Editors:Within Darktrace PREVENT, Darktrace today launches two new products. In addition, Darktrace is announcing major new releases to its existing Darktrace DETECT and Darktrace RESPOND product families, enabling all products to interact with one another as key components of the Cyber AI Loop.Darktrace PREVENT/E2E (End-to-End) - an outcomes-based approach to managing cyber risk, incorporating the best capabilities from across multiple disciplines including attack path modelling, automated penetration testing, breach & attack emulation, security awareness testing and training, and vulnerability prioritization.Darktrace PREVENT/ASM (Attack Surface Management) - AI performs reconnaissance on a specific target by simply knowing the name of the entity, with zero scope and delivering value across many use cases including shadow IT, supply chain, mergers & acquisitions, configuration errors, and many others.DETECT, RESPOND FEEDBACK LOOP - Existing capabilities integrated with Darktrace PREVENT/E2E and PREVENT/ASM reinforce one another to create a continuous feedback loop for always-on learning from the threat landscape.About DarktraceDarktrace (DARK.L), a global leader in cyber security artificial intelligence, is on a mission to free the world from cyber disruption. Breakthrough innovations in our Cyber AI Research Centre in Cambridge, UK have resulted in over 100 patents filed and research published to contribute to the cyber security community. Rather than study attacks, our technology continuously learns and updates its knowledge of \\'you\\' and applies that understanding to optimize your state of optimal cyber security. We are delivering the first ever Cyber AI Loop, fueling a continuous end-to-end security capability that can autonomously spot and respond to novel in-progress threats within seconds.

       " \"p3.8xlarge 32 4 244 GiB 12,24Anyone who has ever trained a Machine or Deep Learning model knows that using a GPU can decrease the training time from days / hours to minutes / seconds, right?But, is it really necessary? Can't we use a cluster of cheap machines, as we do with Bigdata?The simplest and most direct answer is: YES, GPUs are needed to train models and nothing will replace them. However, you have to program properly in order to get the best out of using GPU, and not all libraries and frameworks do this efficiently.How the GPU worksLet's start with an analogy, adapted from what I saw on a data science training, and which I really liked.Imagine a huge motorcycle, like ... 1000 CC ... I don't know, a Kawazaki. It's a very fast bike, right? Now, imagine that you have 8 of these bikes and you want to deliver pizza. Each motorcycle can take 1 order to the customer, so if there are more than 8 orders, someone will have to wait for one of the bikes to be available for delivery.This is how the CPU works: Very fast and focused on sequential processing. Each core is a very fast bike. Of course, you can adapt it so that each motorcycle delivers more than one pizza at a time, but, in any case, it will be sequential processing: Deliver one pizza, deliver the next, etc.Now, let's think you have 2000 bikes and 2000 delivery people. Although the bikes are much faster, you have a lot more bikes and can deliver multiple orders at once, avoiding queues. The slowness of the bikes is compensated by the parallelism.GPU is parallel processing oriented!If we compare task processing time, the CPU wins, but if we consider the parallelism, in the overall throughput, the GPU is unbeatable. That is why it is used for intensive processing tasks and calculations, such as: Virtual currency mining and Deep Learning.How can we program for the GPUProgramming for GPU is not simple. To start, you have to consider that there is more than one GPU vendor and that there are two more well-known programming frameworks:CUDA: Compute Unified Device Architecture, from Nvidia chips;OpenCL: Used in GPUs from other vendors, such as AMD.The CUDA programming interface is made in C, but there are bindings for Python, like PyCuda and for Java, like JCuda. But they are a little more difficult to learn and program.And you need to understand the CUDA platform well, as well as its individual components, such as cuDNN or cuBLAS.However, there are easier and more interesting alternatives that use the GPU, such as Deeplearning4J and its associated project, ND4J. ND4J is like the numpy of Java, only with steroids! It is capable of allowing you to use the available GPU (s) in a simple and practical way, and that is what we will use in this tutorial.First of allYou must have an NVidia GPU on your device, with the appropriate drivers installed. Find out which GPU you have. Then, make sure you have installed the correct Nvidia driver. Then, install the CUDA Toolkit. If everything is correct, you can run the command below:nvidia-smi\",\n",

       " \"     The age of algorithms is here, and it is really changing people's lives. More and more ethical problems related to algorithms have attracted people's attention, but the related ethical research is still far behind the research of algorithms. As more intelligent algorithms emerge in an endless stream, there will also be a lot of algorithmic ethical issues. On the other hand, with the continuous improvement of the development level of the automobile industry, people have a stronger demand for the safety and stability of modern transportation, and more and more autonomous driving technology has been promoted and applied in the market. At present, most of the studies on the longitudinal collision avoidance system of vehicles use collision warning or emergency braking to avoid collision. However, when the vehicle is in a special situation such as high speed and slippery road, emergency steering is more effective. In order to further improve the vehicle safety and ethical algorithm design points, this article revolves around vehicle lateral active collision avoidance control method research, the collision avoidance decision-making, and path planning and collision avoidance transverse vehicle longitudinal motion control is analyzed, and based on automated driving simulation experiment, the tests carried out to verify the designed control strategy. The experimental results show that the proposed method not only has a good effect of preventing automatic driving collision but also can meet the requirements of algorithm ethics. This research can effectively guide the research of algorithmic ethics in the field of autonomous driving and effectively reduce the occurrence of traffic accidents.\",\n",

       " ' /PRNewswire/ -- CONSUMER ELECTRONICS SHOW (CES) –Aromyx, a leading sensory science and data company that biologically replicates the human senses of taste and smell, today announced its consumer-facing product recommendation AI technology. This technology suggests food, beverage, or fragrance products for consumers based on how a product\\'s taste or smell matches an individual\\'s own taste and smell affinities. It identifies the products that a consumer views positively or negatively, and matches them with profiled products that best meet their personal preferences. Unlike other recommendation algorithms, Aromyx\\'s technology is based on human biological responses to taste and smell and AI, not mere inferences based on other people\\'s purchasing behavior. This allows for personalized recommendations that are the basis for nuanced product comparisons and selections.How it works: Aromyx conducts lab screening and analysis to objectively measure how a product\\'s taste or smell would be perceived by the customers\\' target audience.Using the laboratory and data analysis results, Aromyx builds a custom consumer-facing interface to access the customers\\' extensive product profile database that they then use to query shoppers in search of recommendations for products they will love.The interface queries consumers. Whether in-person or online, shoppers answer a series of questions about their taste and scent preferences. Their responses provide the basis for the product recommendations.\"Why guess what consumers will like when you can know? Curating your consumers\\' decision set can mean the difference between a shopper\\'s confident purchase vs. their abandoning the intended purchase. Our sensory science helps retailers make data-driven product recommendations that leverage our unique insights about human taste and smell,\"\\xa0said Elise Kern, Senior Vice President, Data and Insights, Aromyx. \"For the first time, consumers can receive food, beverage and perfume recommendations based on objective measurements of taste and smell that match their individual preferences and discover products they may not have otherwise.\"About AromyxAromyx has re-engineered sensory-based consumer choice. Using human olfactory and taste receptors to objectively offer unbiased taste and smell insights, Aromyx has brought these senses into the digital realm. This data is leveraged to solve product development challenges including: sugar and alcohol reduction, ingredient replacement, and reformulations. This is all done without animal testing and no consumer panels are required to acquire insights about consumers. This technology has helped customers cut product development cycles and has the potential to provide confidence in eCommerce shopping, where flavored and scented product purchase decisions are made without the benefit of a live trial.By enabling clear, reproducible digital profiles of smell and taste, Aromyx technology is disrupting a range of industries. Aromyx has over two dozen Fortune 500 customers in the U.S., Japan, China, and Europe, and is backed by institutional and corporate investors in each of those regions.

Image courtesy of Annie Spratt on Pixabay.My 8-year-old nephew once asked me, “what do you do for a living?” I told him that I was a data scientist. He then asked me “how many beakers do you have?” Besides thinking that kids say the darndest things, I quickly realized this child had absolutely no clue about what I did. Why would he? That’s why I wrote\\xa0The ABCs of Data Science\\xa0— to create exposure about Data Science amongst the next generation and because it will be a critical discipline for the future workforce. But also, tell a few jokes and make fun of people like myself.So, if you had to tell someone what I do, how would I explain data science concepts to a friend not in the field? I would probably use statistics concepts like “average” or “median” to get some of the concepts across. Now, how about explaining it to my nephew? Tough, right? The ABCs of Data Science — Letter PIt took me months (even years if you count my first rough notes) to write the ABCs of Data Science, a book filled with fun illustrations and simple definitions of Data Science that can be understood relatively easily by young kids but also is very relevant for adults. Going into it, our task seemed simple: 26 letters in the alphabet, 26 definitions, and some fun illustrations to go along with it. Over time, the book became an iterative process (yes, I for Iteration also made it) of writing definitions, my friend reviewing it, and then me rewriting and so went the cycle. This was the story of the summer until we brought in some more expert Data Scientist friends who cemented the definition and gave us more ideas for illustrations. Anyway, let’s get to what’s inside!  The All-Star Office Team of the ABCs of Data ScienceOne of my favorite parts of writing the book was the characters that take you through the book’s journey and really bring it to life.\\xa0Data Science Dolphin\\xa0(nothing less than Wonder Woman, I am a DC comics guy) was just waiting for her solo movie after appearing in the\\xa0ABCs of Product Management (written by my editors). We really wanted to create some new characters as part of the journey in assisting DS Dolphin and created Analyst Armadillo and Z-Score Zebra to take the reader through the Data Science definitions.Let’s look at a definition: G for Gaussian Distribution!A Gaussian Distribution (also called a Normal Distribution) is the name for a bell-shaped curve that describes many different types of data sets. Once a Data Scientist recognizes the shape, they can make better predictions about the rest of the data!When I got to writing G (which I skipped and then came back to), I had no words left, quite literally, and was quite dumbfounded as to how hard it was to put this into simple words. How do we explain what a distribution is, since D is for Data (not distribution) in the book, and do we stress the fact that Gaussian is a Distribution, or do we explain how important the Gaussian Distribution is in all of Statistics and Data Science? The one thing I learned writing these definitions (imagining a 9 or 10-year-old kid was reading the book) is that you just have to lay it all out in simple language. I think the definition we ended up with gets the point across — “Describes different types of data sets”, a Distribution, and “they can make better predictions about the rest of the data”. A Normal Distribution usually makes it easier for the data scientists to understand certain properties of the data set.The book is now available on Amazon! First, I would highly recommend checking out our\\xa0website\\xa0for an inside look into the characters and some of the fun definitions! We even did a\\xa0live reading\\xa0on Facebook which will hopefully give you more of a background on why we wrote the book.So why did we write the book and why a kids book on Data Science? Data Science, as we know, is one of the most sought-after positions, let alone in tech and for great reason: Data Science encompasses Machine Learning, AI, Mathematics, Statistics, Programming, etc, all fields that will continue to transform companies and shape our future. For me, it is important that we start early and get kids curious as early as elementary school. Ultimately, we hope that the book might motivate your kid, cousin, niece, or nephew to pick up math or programming, inspire even one of them, if we’re lucky.About me: I am a Data Scientist and Product Manager at Komodo Health, a healthcare SaaS company.

Russian President Vladimir Putin in prison grays behind the bars of a dimly lit concrete cell.The highly detailed, sensational images have inundated Twitter and other platforms in recent days, amid news that Trump faces possible criminal charges and the International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Putin.Fake image: An artificial intelligence-generated image of US President DonaldCredit:Twitter/@EliotHigginsBut neither visual is remotely real. The images — and scores of variations littering social media — were produced using increasingly sophisticated and widely accessible image generators powered by artificial intelligence.Misinformation experts warn the images are harbingers of a new reality: waves of fake photos and videos flooding social media after major news events and further muddying fact and fiction at crucial times for society.“It does add noise during crisis events. It also increases the cynicism level,” said Jevin West, a professor at the University of Washington in Seattle who focuses on the spread of misinformation. “You start to lose trust in the system and the information that you are getting.”While the ability to manipulate photos and create fake images isn’t new, AI image generator tools by Midjourney, DALL-E and others are easier to use. They can quickly generate realistic images — complete with detailed backgrounds — on a mass scale with little more than a simple text prompt from users.Some of the recent images have been driven by this month’s release of a new version of Midjourney’s text-to-image synthesis model, which can, among other things, now produce convincing images mimicking the style of news agency photos.In one widely-circulating Twitter thread, Eliot Higgins, founder of Bellingcat, a Netherlands-based investigative journalism collective, used the latest version of the tool to conjure up scores of dramatic images of Trump’s fictional arrest.AdvertisementThe visuals, which have been shared and liked tens of thousands of times, showed a crowd of uniformed officers grabbing the Republican billionaire and violently pulling him down onto the pavement.Higgins, who was also behind a set of images of Putin being arrested, put on trial and then imprisoned, says he posted the images with no ill intent. He even stated clearly in his Twitter thread that the images were AI-generated.Still, the images were enough to get him locked out of the Midjourney server, according to Higgins. The San Francisco-based independent research lab didn’t respond to emails seeking comment.“The Trump arrest image was really just casually showing both how good and bad Midjourney was at rendering real scenes,” Higgins wrote in an email. “The images started to form a sort of narrative as I plugged in prompts to Midjourney, so I strung them along into a narrative, and decided to finish off the story.”He pointed out the images are far from perfect: in some, Trump is seen, oddly, wearing a police utility belt. In others, faces and hands are clearly distorted.But it’s not enough that users like Higgins clearly state in their posts that the images are AI-generated and solely for entertainment, says Shirin Anlen, media technologist at Witness, a New York-based human rights organisation that focuses on visual evidence.Too often, the visuals are quickly reshared by others without that crucial context, she said. Indeed, an Instagram post sharing some of Higgins’ images of Trump as if they were genuine garnered more than 79,000 likes.“You’re just seeing an image, and once you see something, you cannot unsee it,” Anlen said.In another recent example, social media users shared a synthetic image supposedly capturing Putin kneeling and kissing the hand of Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The image, which circulated as the Russian president welcomed Xi to the Kremlin this week, quickly became a crude meme.LoadingIt’s not clear who created created the image or what tool they used, but some clues gave the forgery away. The heads and shoes of the two leaders were slightly distorted, for example, and the room’s interior didn’t match the room where the actual meeting took place.With synthetic images becoming increasingly difficult to discern from the real thing, the best way to combat visual misinformation is better public awareness and education, experts say.“It’s just becoming so easy and it’s so cheap to make these images that we should do whatever we can to make the public aware of how good this technology has gotten,” West said.Higgins suggests social media companies could focus on developing technology to detect AI-generated images and integrate that into their platforms.LoadingTwitter has a policy banning “synthetic, manipulated, or out-of-context media” with the potential to deceive or harm. Annotations from Community Notes, Twitter’s crowd-sourced fact checking project, were attached to some tweets to include the context that the Trump images were AI-generated.When reached for comment on Thursday, the company emailed back only an automated response.Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, declined to comment. Some of the fabricated Trump images were labelled as either “false” or “missing context” through its third-party fact-checking program, of which the AP is a participant.Arthur Holland Michel, a fellow at the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs in New York who is focused on emerging technologies, said he worries the world isn’t ready for the impending deluge.He wonders how deepfakes involving ordinary people — harmful fake pictures of an ex-partner or a colleague, for example — will be regulated.“From a policy perspective, I’m not sure we’re prepared to deal with this scale of disinformation at every level of society,” Michel wrote in an email.“My sense is that it’s going to take an as-yet-unimagined technical breakthrough to definitively put a stop to this.”APGet a note directly from our foreign correspondents on what’s making headlines around the world.

       " \"Newswise — The wind energy industry could soon count on a much-needed precise analysis to achieve an optimal balance for wind farm productivity and profitability, thanks to a team of researchers working with digitization, predictive and prescriptive analytics to bring down its operational costs.Rutgers researchers led by Principal Investigator Ahmed Aziz Ezzat, assistant professor of Industrial & Systems Engineering at the School of Engineering, and Co-Principal Investigator Joseph F. Brodie, Offshore Wind Research Lead and director of Atmospheric Research at the Rutgers Center for Ocean Observing Leadership are teaming up with researchers from Wayne State University, Argonne National Laboratory, and Cognite. Their ultimate goal is to bring data and decision sciences closer towards meeting the ambitious 35%-by-2050 U.S. wind energy target.Rutgers and Wayne received a $450,000 grant award from the National Science Foundation (NSF) for their academia-industry collaborative project that will run for three years. Wayne’s Principal Investigator is Murat Yildirim.“We aim to formulate a decision-theoretic approach to jointly optimize generation and maintenance in wind farms, taking into account the uncertainties that could arise from weather variability, generation of electricity and profits, and the degradation of key turbine components,” said Ezzat. “For wind farm operators, wind is both the promise and the peril – it is the primary resource of electricity generation and hence, profits, but is also the main driver of structural degradation, and ultimately, maintenance expenses. We will re-envision a challenging generation-degradation trade-off in the wind industry through a data science and systems engineering lens.”The US Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy plans to accelerate the transition to a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions ensuring clean energy while creating jobs. According to the Office, by 2050, wind power could fund more than 600,000 jobs in manufacturing, installation, maintenance, and other services. A 2020 report from the Department of Energy indicated a record growth in land-based and offshore wind energy.While Ezzat acknowledges that wind energy still faces barriers related to its operations and maintenance (O&M) costs, he reaffirms that the industry is attractive and competitive relative to conventional fossil-fuel energy sources. And he says it needs better models and solutions to become more cost-efficient.“We’ll search for timely solutions to enhance the operational efficiency in wind farms, thus facilitating wind energy’s cost-effective integration into the U.S. electricity grid,” added Ezzat. “The industry has been primarily driven by the economic value of operations and maintenance decisions. Our proposed ideas align well with the farm operators' mindset and, hence, have the potential to reshape the prevalent single-faceted O&M strategies which have largely overlooked the dependencies between the generation and degradation processes in wind turbine assets.”The main ingredient of the data science solutions, according to Ezzat, is the rich information collected by sensors in modern-day wind farms including historical SCADA records, weather variables, structural health parameters, and other data. The research team will create digital representations of how the turbines have been working, are currently working and how they could be more productive to reliably generate electricity under various weather conditions while ensuring optimal maintenance at the best possible time.As part of the project, the researchers will use data obtained through wind farms in other parts of the world through an agreement with a major wind energy developer headquartered in Europe.The collaboration with Cognite, a leader in industrial software innovation for the full-scale digital transformation of asset-heavy industries, will accelerate the translation of the proposed data science solutions into tangible industrial impact.“Our core Industrial DataOps platform, Cognite Data Fusion™, liberates and contextualizes data for quick collaboration on the development, operationalization, and scale of industrial AI solutions and applications. This project with Rutgers is an exciting opportunity to leverage emerging technologies like hybrid AI, machine learning, and 3D modeling to develop wholistic, sustainable, and scalable solutions in the wind market,” said Mina Mousa, Co-PI and Senior Data Scientist at Cognite. “We’re tackling predictive maintenance and power production optimization simultaneously to drive overall cost of operation to the absolute minimum, which can have a big impact on the growth of wind energy moving forward.”“Data science has the potential to help us to better generate power,” added Ezzat. “We can reliably and cost-effectively power up and generate clean energy if equipped with the right data science tools.” \",\n",

       " ' /PRNewswire/ -- The Institute for Workplace Equality (\"The Institute\") announced today the release of a significant report by a Technical Advisory Committee (\"AI-TAC\") it sponsored to address issues about the use of Artificial Intelligence (\"AI\") in employment.The \"Technical Advisory Committee Report on EEO and DEI&A Considerations in the Use of Artificial Intelligence in Employment Decision Making,\" provides a series of key findings and recommendations for employers and developers to responsibly use AI-enabled tools within the current regulatory and legal framework for equal employment opportunity (EEO) and non-discrimination.The report culminates 18 months of analysis and in-depth discussion by the members of the AI-TAC, a multi-disciplinary group of 40 experts. The group consisted of lawyers (representing both employers and workers), industrial-organizational psychologists, developers, vendors, data scientists, statisticians, and labor economists. The TAC was chaired by Victoria A. Lipnic, partner at Resolution Economics, LLC and former Commissioner and acting Chair of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\"This Report provides a 360-degree technical review designed to help all stakeholders – employers, applicants and employees, developers, and regulators – better understand and navigate crucial EEO and anti-discrimination issues as they apply to the use of AI-enabled employment tools within the current regulatory framework,\" Ms. Lipnic said.The Report gives examples of uses of AI in employment and takes a deep dive into issues around transparency and fairness, data collection, the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures and Statistics and Adverse Impact. It provides recommendations on the proper way to create data samples to develop and evaluate an AI-enabled tool so as to avoid building in bias; benchmarks for providing appropriate notice to applicants regarding the use of AI-enabled tools; and considerations to take into account when validating AI-enabled tools.In addition to recommendations focused on the use of AI-enabled employment tools generally, the Report notes that AI tools that use machine learning (also known as \"intelligent AI\") raise distinct issues. Machine learning is a form of AI that \"learns\" and changes on the basis of data or experience, without being explicitly programmed. The Report recommends that employers and vendors take special care in regard to such tools. This includes:Developing a policy for version control and associated guardrails around substantive changes to the functioning of the machine-learning tool.Ensuring that the data used in machine learning as well as the key choices made in collecting, cleaning, training, and maintaining a dataset and building a selection algorithm should be documented and a rationale provided. Documentation should be sufficient to assess data reliability and validity and allow for computational reproducibility.\"Over the past few years, we have been counseling employers who are increasingly using AI-enabled tools in their employee life cycle. They want to do so on the right side of compliance. We organized this technical advisory committee to better inform them how to do so,\" said David Fortney, co-founder of The Institute for Workplace Equality and Shareholder at Fortney & Scott, LLC.David Cohen, co-founder of The Institute and President of DCI Consulting added: \"There are many important subtleties associated with standards for employee selection and those should be applied to AI-tools, just as they are to traditional tools used by employers.

       " ' /PRNewswire/ --\\xa0Drift, the Conversation Cloud company, today announced a generative pretrained transformer (GPT) integration using OpenAI\\'s API, available exclusively to select Drift customers. The initial integration provides artificial intelligence (AI) suggested replies in live chat, allowing sales representatives (reps) to immediately respond to complex customer questions without ever having to leave the conversation.Drift Logo (PRNewsfoto/Drift.com, Inc.)(PRNewswire)The AI will suggest a reply for the sales rep to use based on their company\\'s website content and marketing materials, the context of that specific conversation and GPT. The sales rep will have the option to customize the suggested reply before sending, or dismiss it and generate a new suggested reply if the first one didn\\'t meet their needs. The ability to generate suggested replies by repurposing any available content also provides real-time on-the-job training for new sales reps (which currently takes three months on average), teaching them how to respond accurately and in the right brand voice.Gaps in education and training were cited as the top barrier to AI adoption by 63% of marketers and sales reps polled in Drift\\'s recent 2022 State of Marketing and Sales AI Report. Large language models, like ChatGPT, are helping change that by making AI usable and understandable to everyone. It is one of the first AI technologies made available to the public in a way that non-technical experts can understand and experiment with.\"The buzz around ChatGPT, and the widespread experimentation that\\xa0 followed, has only underscored that conversation-based AI is paving the way of the future. But, it needs to be tailored to solve meaningful business challenges,\" said Matt Tippets, senior vice president at Drift. \"With Drift\\'s ability to use Conversational AI to contextualize responses that augment the efforts of human teams, we\\'ve created a feature that helps sales reps of all experience levels be more productive, particularly relevant now with pressure on during a more difficult economic climate.\"While B2B sales and marketing professionals are excited by the possibilities of GPT implementations, many are hesitant about potential risks. By combining Drift\\'s trusted Conversational AI with GPT, marketing and sales reps will be able to more quickly and accurately respond to customers in chat.This aligns with Drift\\'s mission to help businesses connect with people at the right time, in the right place, with the right conversation.Additional features that will be available later this year within the Drift GPT integration include:Automated content creation and ongoing optimization of playbooksAutomated onboarding and AI topic trainingPersonalizing sales outreach and prioritizing target accounts\"I\\'ve always admired Drift\\'s customer-centric approach to building practical AI tools, and suggested replies is a great addition that will immediately increase productivity for users,\" said Paul Roetzer, founder and CEO of Marketing AI Institute.Drift\\'s GPT integration will enter its Beta stage in March with select customers.

Data is what makes a difference in AI now. Data and analytics leaders want to improve the delivery of AI results with data innovations.\" The report also noted that \"AI teams are expanding their focus from model development to data that makes these models effective. Many of them are unaware of the proven data management solutions and are looking for AI-specific data offerings to improve and simplify their data-related efforts.\"Vector search can be more accurate and intuitive than traditional keyword search methods, which require the user to make guesses about how data is structured. Before Pinecone, only a few tech giants had the engineering resources and budgets to build their own vector databases. Pinecone\\'s fully-managed vector database enables organizations of any size to quickly move similarity search and recommendation engines into production without tasking a large group of ML and database engineers to build and maintain one of their own.Vector databases often require expensive infrastructures to operate and are notoriously difficult to manage. Pinecone solves both of these challenges with a solution that was built to efficiently store and query vector data within a platform that is easy to use.\"We are honored to be recognized as a 2021 Gartner Cool Vendor which we believe is a powerful recognition of the value of vector databases and our work to expand AI-based search technology,\" said Edo Liberty, Founder & CEO of Pinecone. \"We introduced the vector database and we continue to work with our customers to ensure it powers the best search and recommendation experiences available.\"Gartner clients can\\xa0access the full report.*Gartner, \"Cool Vendors in Data for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning,\" Svetlana Sicular, Chirag Dekate, Anthony Mullen, Arun Chandrasekaran, Afraz Jaffri, ',\n",

       "' /PRNewswire/ --\\xa0Pinecone Systems Inc., a machine learning (ML) cloud infrastructure company, announced today that it has been named a Gartner Cool Vendor in the October 2021 Gartner Cool Vendors™ in Data for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning*.According to the report, \"As AI and ML techniques become common in the enterprise, data is coming to the foreground. Data is what makes a difference in AI now. Data and analytics leaders want to improve the delivery of AI results with data innovations.\" The report also noted that \"AI teams are expanding their focus from model development to data that makes these models effective. Many of them are unaware of the proven data management solutions and are looking for AI-specific data offerings to improve and simplify their data-related efforts.\"Vector search can be more accurate and intuitive than traditional keyword search methods, which require the user to make guesses about how data is structured. Before Pinecone, only a few tech giants had the engineering resources and budgets to build their own vector databases. Pinecone\\'s fully-managed vector database enables organizations of any size to quickly move similarity search and recommendation engines into production without tasking a large group of ML and database engineers to build and maintain one of their own.Vector databases often require expensive infrastructures to operate and are notoriously difficult to manage. Pinecone solves both of these challenges with a solution that was built to efficiently store and query vector data within a platform that is easy to use.\"We are honored to be recognized as a 2021 Gartner Cool Vendor which we believe is a powerful recognition of the value of vector databases and our work to expand AI-based search technology,\" said Edo Liberty, Founder & CEO of Pinecone. \"We introduced the vector database and we continue to work with our customers to ensure it powers the best search and recommendation experiences available.\"Gartner clients can\\xa0access the full report.*Gartner, \"Cool Vendors in Data for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning,\" Svetlana Sicular, Chirag Dekate, Anthony Mullen, Arun Chandrasekaran, Afraz Jaffri, '"
