# Unraveling the Data Science Revolution - NLP Final Project

This repository contains materials for the MSCA 32018 Natural Language Processing and Cognitive Computing Project at the University of Chicago.

## Problem Statement
In March of 2023, Goldman Sachs published a report, indicating that ~25% of the tasks in US and Europe can be automated using AI.  However, not all industries will be affected equally. According to the report, certain jobs, like office tasks, legal, architecture and social sciences have a potential for 30%+ automation, while positions like construction, installation and building maintenance are going to be largely unaffected.

The objective of this final project is to identify what types of tasks and jobs are most likely to see the biggest impact from AI by extracting meaningful insights from unstructured text.  Our goal is to provide actionable recommendations on what can be done with AI to automate the jobs and / or improve employee productivity.

## Data
We have a data of 200k news articles about Data Science and AI published since 2020. 

## How to Navigate This Repository
In this repo you will find two folders: sample and all_data.
- `sample` contains coding done on a subset of news articles as feasibility testing, as well as some sample data used.
- `all_data` contains coding done on all news articles, including cleaning, feature engineering, analysis, and modeling. Majority of coding is conducted on Google Cloud Platforms (GCP).
- You can also check out the presentation deck at `MSCA32018_Final_Presentation.pdf`.
