                Zhe Zhu, University of Connecticut and Su Ye, University of Connecticut
 (THE CONVERSATION) Hurricane Ian left an extraordinarily broad path of destruction across much of South Florida. That was evident in reports from the ground, but it also shows up in satellite data. Using a new method, our team of spatial and environmental analysts was able to quickly provide a rare big picture view of damage across the entire state.

 By using satellite images from before the storm and real-time images from four satellite sensors, together with artificial intelligence, we created a disaster monitoring system that can map damage in 30-meter resolution and continuously update the data.

 It’s a snapshot of what faster, more targeted disaster monitoring can look like in the future – and something that could eventually be deployed nationwide.

                How artificial intellegence spots the damage

Satellites are already used to identify high-risk areas for floods, wildfires, landslides and other disasters, and to pinpoint the damage after these disasters. But most satelite-based disaster management approaches rely on visually assessing the latest images, one neighborhood at a time.
Our technique automatically compares pre-storm images with current satellite images to spot anomalies quickly over large areas. Those anomalies might be sand or water where that sand or water shouldn’t be, or heavily damaged roofs that don’t match their pre-storm appearance. Each area with a significant anomaly is flagged in yellow.
Five days after Ian lashed Florida, the map showed yellow alert polygons all over South Florida. We found that it could spot patches of damage with about 84% accuracy.
A natural disaster like a hurricane or tornado often leaves behind large areas of spectral change at the surface, meaning changes in how light reflects off whatever is there, such as houses, ground or water. Our algorithm compares the reflectance in models based on pre-storm images with reflectance after the storm.
The system spots both changes in physical properties of natural areas, such as changes in wetness or brightness, and the overall intensity of the change. An increase in brightness often is related to exposed sand or bare land due to hurricane damage.
Using a machine-learning model, we can use those images to predict disturbance probabilities, which measures the influences of natural disaster on land surfaces. This approach allows us to automate disaster mapping and provide full coverage of an entire state as soon as the satellite data is released.
The system uses data from four satellites, Landsat 8 and Landsat 9, both operated by NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey, and Sentinel 2A and Sentinel 2B, launched as part of the European Commission’s Copernicus program.

                Real-time monitoring, nationwide

Extreme storms with destructive flooding have been documented with increasing frequency over large parts of the globe in recent years.
While disaster response teams can rely on airplane surveillance and drones to pinpoint damage in small areas, it’s much harder to see the big picture in a widespread disaster like hurricanes and other tropical cyclones, and time is of the essence. Our system provides a fast approach using free government-produced images to see the big picture. One current drawback is the timing of those images, which often aren’t released publicly until a few days after the disaster.
We are now working on developing near real-time monitoring of the whole conterminous United States to quickly provide the most up-to-date land information for the next natural disaster.

OpenAI, the artificial-intelligence research company behind the popular ChatGPT chatbot, has recently come under fire for biases, inaccuracies and inappropriate behavior. (Bloomberg)

 Vanderbilt University's Peabody College is facing growing anger after administrators used ChatGPT to write a message about the importance of community following a deadly campus shooting in Michigan.  The Nashville, Tennessee-based school's Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion said in a Feb. 16 email that “creating a safe and inclusive environment is an ongoing process that requires ongoing effort and commitment.” A line at the bottom of the five-paragraph email said it had been paraphrased using ChatGPT, an AI text generator.    The email was sent in response to a shooting earlier this week, when a gunman killed three people and injured five others at Michigan State University's campus in East Lansing on Monday night. The suspect was later found dead after apparently taking his own life. There have been 73 mass shootings in the US this year, according to data from the Gun Violence Archive.    OpenAI, the artificial-intelligence research company behind the popular ChatGPT chatbot, has recently come under fire for biases, inaccuracies and inappropriate behavior. The controversial tool has sparked a fierce debate over the ethics and implications of its use in a wide variety of situations.  Freshman Martha Chessen took particular umbrage at the use of ChatGPT to write an email about gun violence.  “It's almost as if Vanderbilt sent the email merely out of obligation, rather than a genuine care for the needs of its community,” she said. “I'm disappointed in Vanderbilt's lack of empathy toward those suffering from the tragedy.”  Laith Kayat, a Vanderbilt senior from Michigan, was quoted by Vanderbilt University's student newspaper, The Vanderbilt Hustler: “There is a sick and twisted irony to making a computer write your message about community and togetherness because you can't be bothered to reflect on it yourself.”  Nicole Joseph, associate dean for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion, apologized for showing poor judgment in using the AI technology.  “Using ChatGPT to generate communications on behalf of our community in a time of sorrow and in response to a tragedy contradicts the values that characterize Peabody College,” Joseph said in an email. “Open-source AI platforms are novel technologies, and we are all still learning about the power of their capabilities as well as their limits.”

(THE CONVERSATION) Progress in artificial intelligence has enabled the creation of AIs that perform tasks previously thought only possible for humans, such as translating languages, driving cars, playing board games at world-champion level and extracting the structure of proteins. However, each of these AIs has been designed and exhaustively trained for a single task and has the ability to learn only what’s needed for that specific task.
 
Recent AIs that produce fluent text, including in conversation with humans, and generate impressive and unique art can give the false impression of a mind at work. But even these are specialized systems that carry out narrowly defined tasks and require massive amounts of training.


It still remains a daunting challenge to combine multiple AIs into one that can learn and perform many different tasks, much less pursue the full breadth of tasks performed by humans or leverage the range of experiences available to humans that reduce the amount of data otherwise required to learn how to perform these tasks. The best current AIs in this respect, such as AlphaZero and Gato, can handle a variety of tasks that fit a single mold, like game-playing. Artificial general intelligence (AGI) that is capable of a breadth of tasks remains elusive.


Ultimately, AGIs need to be able to interact effectively with each other and people in various physical environments and social contexts, integrate the wide varieties of skill and knowledge needed to do so, and learn flexibly and efficiently from these interactions.
Building AGIs comes down to building artificial minds, albeit greatly simplified compared to human minds. And to build an artificial mind, you need to start with a model of cognition.

                From human to Artificial General Intelligence

Humans have an almost unbounded set of skills and knowledge, and quickly learn new information without needing to be re-engineered to do so. It is conceivable that an AGI can be built using an approach that is fundamentally different from human intelligence. However, as three longtime researchers in AI and cognitive science, our approach is to draw inspiration and insights from the structure of the human mind. We are working toward AGI by trying to better understand the human mind, and better understand the human mind by working toward AGI.

From research in neuroscience, cognitive science and psychology, we know that the human brain is neither a huge homogeneous set of neurons nor a massive set of task-specific programs that each solves a single problem. Instead, it is a set of regions with different properties that support the basic cognitive capabilities that together form the human mind.
These capabilities include perception and action; short-term memory for what is relevant in the current situation; long-term memories for skills, experience and knowledge; reasoning and decision making; emotion and motivation; and learning new skills and knowledge from the full range of what a person perceives and experiences.
Instead of focusing on specific capabilities in isolation, AI pioneer Allen Newell in 1990 suggested developing Unified Theories of Cognition that integrate all aspects of human thought. Researchers have been able to build software programs called cognitive architectures that embody such theories, making it possible to test and refine them.
Cognitive architectures are grounded in multiple scientific fields with distinct perspectives. Neuroscience focuses on the organization of the human brain, cognitive psychology on human behavior in controlled experiments, and artificial intelligence on useful capabilities.

                The Common Model of Cognition

We have been involved in the development of three cognitive architectures: ACT-R, Soar and Sigma. Other researchers have also been busy on alternative approaches. One paper identified nearly 50 active cognitive architectures. This proliferation of architectures is partly a direct reflection of the multiple perspectives involved, and partly an exploration of a wide array of potential solutions. Yet, whatever the cause, it raises awkward questions both scientifically and with respect to finding a coherent path to AGI.
Fortunately, this proliferation has brought the field to a major inflection point. The three of us have identified a striking convergence among architectures, reflecting a combination of neural, behavioral and computational studies. In response, we initiated a communitywide effort to capture this convergence in a manner akin to the Standard Model of Particle Physics that emerged in the second half of the 20th century.

Savvy Senior: Should you take daily aspirin for your heart?  
This Common Model of Cognition divides humanlike thought into multiple modules, with a short-term memory module at the center of the model. The other modules – perception, action, skills and knowledge – interact through it.
Learning, rather than occurring intentionally, happens automatically as a side effect of processing. In other words, you don’t decide what is stored in long-term memory. Instead, the architecture determines what is learned based on whatever you do think about. This can yield learning of new facts you are exposed to or new skills that you attempt. It can also yield refinements to existing facts and skills.
The modules themselves operate in parallel; for example, allowing you to remember something while listening and looking around your environment. Each module’s computations are massively parallel, meaning many small computational steps happening at the same time. For example, in retrieving a relevant fact from a vast trove of prior experiences, the long-term memory module can determine the relevance of all known facts simultaneously, in a single step.

                Guiding the way to Artificial General Intelligence

The Common Model is based on the current consensus in research in cognitive architectures and has the potential to guide research on both natural and artificial general intelligence. When used to model communication patterns in the brain, the Common Model yields more accurate results than leading models from neuroscience. This extends its ability to model humans – the one system proven capable of general intelligence – beyond cognitive considerations to include the organization of the brain itself.
We are starting to see efforts to relate existing cognitive architectures to the Common Model and to use it as a baseline for new work – for example, an interactive AI designed to coach people toward better health behavior. One of us was involved in developing an AI based on Soar, dubbed Rosie, that learns new tasks via instructions in English from human teachers. It learns 60 different puzzles and games and can transfer what it learns from one game to another. It also learns to control a mobile robot for tasks such as fetching and delivering packages and patrolling buildings.
Rosie is just one example of how to build an AI that approaches AGI via a cognitive architecture that is well characterized by the Common Model. In this case, the AI automatically learns new skills and knowledge during general reasoning that combines natural language instruction from humans and a minimal amount of experience – in other words, an AI that functions more like a human mind than today’s AIs, which learn via brute computing force and massive amounts of data.
From a broader AGI perspective, we look to the Common Model both as a guide in developing such architectures and AIs, and as a means for integrating the insights derived from those attempts into a consensus that ultimately leads to AGI.

(PRNewsfoto/VISIMO)With the development of autonomous weapons, the speed of warfare is increasing. Stationed at combatant commands and Air Operations Centers worldwide, Judge Advocate General (JAG) Corps members provide critical legal advice during combat, including use-of-force decision-making recommendations. However, Judge Advocates are not equipped to keep pace with modern combat.""The modern battlespace is filled with autonomous systems,"" said Dino Mintas, Chief Data Scientist at VISIMO. ""Because the JAG Corps still uses a largely manual process for use-of-force review, this creates a bottleneck that endangers the Warfighter and the U.S. military's tactical advantage.""VISIMO's AI tool will use a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV) techniques to help Judge Advocates quickly and correctly analyze targeting packages for legal review.Not only will this application benefit the Department of Defense (DoD), but it also has significant implications for improving the civilian legal system.A study from the Brennan Center for Justice found that public defenders typically spend under six minutes on cases where clients plead guilty and are sentenced in their first appearance. This finding indicates that because of extreme caseloads, defenders cannot adequately represent clients' interests. When adapted for civilian use cases, VISIMO's AI tool could help defenders save time by highlighting relevant information in case files.World-leading legal experts from West Point's Lieber Institute are informing the tool's development. The Lieber Institute focuses on the most complex problems surrounding the law of war, including the intersection of law and AI. Legal experts include Professor Michael Schmitt, who is a distinguished scholar at both West Point and the U.S. Naval War College, as well as a senior fellow at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence.This award marks West Point's first ever STTR award.""We're proud to be the first small business to work with West Point in the STTR program,"" said James Julius, VISIMO founder and CEO. ""To have top legal experts, including former JAG Corps members, so excited about this project highlights its potential.""VISIMO and West Point are currently seeking collaborators across the DoD to support the project's continued development in Phase II. Interested parties are encouraged to contact Alex Heit, Vice President of Partnerships & Strategy at VISIMO.[This material is based upon work supported by the United States Air Force AFRL/RG under Contract No. FA864922P0077.

Microsoft is bringing ChatGPT technology to Word, Excel and Outlook 


By Samantha Murphy Kelly, CNN Business
Microsoft on Thursday outlined its plans to bring artificial intelligence to its most recognizable productivity tools, including Outlook, PowerPoint, Excel and Word, with the promise of changing how millions do their work every day.

At an event on Thursday, the company announced that Microsoft 365 users will soon be able to use what the company is calling an AI “Co-pilot,” which will help edit, summarize, create and compare documents. But don’t call it Clippy. The new features, which are built on the same technology that underpins ChatGPT, are far more powerful (and less anthropomorphized) than its wide-eyed, paperclip-shaped predecessor.
With the new features, users will be able to transcribe meeting notes during a Skype call, summarize long email threads to quickly draft suggested replies, request to create a specific chart in Excel, and turn a Word document into a PowerPoint presentation in seconds.
Microsoft is also introducing a concept called Business Chat, an agent that essentially rides along with the user as they work and tries to understand and make sense of their Microsoft 365 data. The agent will know what’s in a user’s email and on their calendar for the day as well as the documents they’ve been working on, the presentations they’ve been making, the people they’re meeting with, and the chats happening on their Teams platform, according to the company. Users can then ask Business Chat to do tasks such as write a status report by summarizing all of the documents across platforms on a certain project, and then draft an email that could be sent to their team with an update.
Microsoft’s announcement comes a month after it brought similar AI-powered features to Bing and amid a renewed arms race in the tech industry to develop and deploy AI tools that can change how people work, shop and create. Earlier this week, rival Google announced it is also bringing AI to its productivity tools, including Gmail, Sheets and Docs.
The news also comes two days after OpenAI, the company behind Microsoft’s artificial intelligence technology and the creator of ChatGPT, unveiled its next-generation model, GPT-4. The update has stunned many users in early tests and a company demo with its ability to draft lawsuits, pass standardized exams and build a working website from a hand-drawn sketch.
OpenAI said it added more “guardrails” to keep conversations on track and has worked to make the tool less biased. But the update, and the moves by larger tech companies to integrate this technology, could add to challenging questions around how AI tools can upend professions, enable students to cheat, and shift our relationship with technology. Microsoft’s new Bing browser has already been using GPT-4, for better or worse.

A Microsoft spokesperson said 365 users accessing the new AI tools should be reminded the technology is a work in progress and information will need to be double checked. Although OpenAI has made vast improvements to its latest model, GPT-4 has similar limitations to previous versions. The company said it can still make “simple reasoning errors” or be “overly gullible in accepting obvious false statements from a user,” and does not fact check.
Still, Microsoft believes the changes will improve the experience of people at work in a significant way by allowing them to do tasks easier and less tedious, freeing them up to be more analytical and creative.

In Texas approdano Avery Bradley, Kelly Olynyk e il diritto a scambiare una scelta futura. Sono tutti in scadenza, a parte Bradley che ha una team option per il prossimo anno.

The trial in Japan marine traffic control was conducted from December 2019 to March 2020 at the Tokyo Wan Vessel Traffic Service Center(1), which offers navigation support services, under an outsourcing contract with the Japan Coast Guard. Screen image of vessel collision prediction technologyEvaluating the practicality of control operationsEvaluation by operation controller at the Tokyo Wan Vessel Traffic Service CenterLeveraging Fujitsu Human Centric AI Zinrai developed by Fujitsu Laboratories Ltd., this technology can detect near-misses between vessels and predict areas where collision risks are concentrated in the Tokyo Bay. By applying this technology to the Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) system(2) used in maritime traffic control operations, Fujitsu has confirmed that it can contribute to the risk prevention of vessels and improve maritime traffic safety. Beginning in April 2020, Fujitsu will bolster its business structure in safe navigation support, promoting the use of this technology in marine traffic control and offering safe navigation support services for marine traffic control and operating vessels.BackgroundAccording to a report by the Japan Transport Safety Board(3), there were 2,863 marine collision accidents in Japan alone between 2009 and 2019, with an average of 286 accidents per year. Collisions involving large vessels can have a major impact on society, in terms of crew safety, damage to vessels, and marine pollution. The Japan Coast Guard operates a navigation support system that combines radar and the Automatic Identification System (AIS) for high-traffic routes, as they ensure maritime traffic safety by conducting navigation support services at such places including the Traffic Advisory Service Center. However, it is not easy to recognize and predict the movements of a large number of vessels in addition to detecting risks. Therefore, the detection of risks and the timing of risk recommendations to vessels depends on the experience and skill of the operation controllers. To solve these challenges, the Japan Coast Guard took the initiative to apply this technology to control operations in Tokyo Bay. The Coast Guard conducted field trials to verify the effectiveness of this technology in improving the safety of marine traffic by detecting collision risks early and optimizing the timing of sharing information to the vessels.Details about the Field TrialUsing the training environment of the Tokyo Wan Vessel Traffic Service Center, with the cooperation of six experienced maritime traffic control operation controllers and instructors, control tasks based on past near miss accidents were simulated to demonstrate the effectiveness of practical operations.Two methods of control operation were evaluated: 1) The conventional method, where operation controllers recognized and predicted the movement of vessels based on their own experience and skills to determine danger (Evaluation 1, below). 2) In addition to conventional control operations, risk information was calculated with collision risk prediction technology by utilizing past AIS data and risk recommendation records from the Japan Coast Guard (Evaluation 2, below).Changes in the analysis of 36 patterns were examined, including differences in monitoring areas, experience and skills of operation controllers.Field Trial ResultsAs a result of the statistical analysis of both Evaluation 1 and 2, it was found that this technology could shorten the time before a risk warning is sent to a vessel by the operation controller by an average of approximately two minutes, enabling the early detection of vessels at risk of collision.It was also confirmed that the number of warnings issued for risk-prone vessels nearly doubled with the technology, indicating proactive preventive measures and the potential to enhance safety in Tokyo Bay.As this technology assists marine control operations by analyzing the qualitative conditions of collision risks, operations could be performed at acceptable levels, regardless of the experience and skill of the operation controllers. It was particularly effective for newcomers, and in some cases they could even perform the same control actions as those conducted by highly skilled controllers. It was also found to be effective in leveling the skills of experienced controllers.Future DevelopmentsBased on the field trial results, Fujitsu will continue to collaborate with the Japan Coast Guard to improve the technology. Accordingly, the company aims to offer services for maritime traffic control as well as services to support safe navigation for operating vessels in the near future.Comment from the Maritime Traffic Department Japan Coast GuardThe field trial has demonstrated that Fujitsu's collision risk prediction technology is effective in assisting operation controllers. Going forward, we will verify more complex traffic conditions and improve the accuracy of the technology, as we plan to implement the development.(1) Tokyo Wan Vessel Traffic Service Center By providing information necessary for safe vessel operation and conducting integrated navigation control, the Center manages the safety of marine traffic in congested sea areas. Tokyo Wan is the Japanese term for Tokyo Bay.(2) VTS (Vessel Traffic Services) system System used for the management of Vessel Traffic Services. Used to provide essential information on shipping and maritime traffic such as those obtained by Automatic Identification Service (AIS), collecting relevant data to improve the safety and efficiency of navigation.(3) Japan Transport Safety Board One of the extra-ministerial bureaus of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. The Board aims to prevent accidents and mitigate damage by investigating the causes of serious incidents and accidents by aircraft, railway, and marine vessels, and advising the Ministry and other concerned parties on the implementation of necessary measures based on their investigation.About FujitsuFujitsu is the leading Japanese information and communication technology (ICT) company, offering a full range of technology products, solutions, and services.

Credit: Jonathan Fickies/BloombergShare to FacebookShare to TwitterEmail UsCopy the LinkGoogle is testing new artificial intelligence-powered chat products that are likely to influence a future public product launch. They include a new chatbot and a potential way to integrate it into a search engine.The Alphabet company is working on a project under its cloud unit called “Atlas,” which is a “code red” effort to respond to ChatGPT, the large-language chatbot that took the public by storm when it went public late last year.Google is also testing a chatbot called “Apprentice Bard,” where employees can ask questions and receive detailed answers similar to ChatGPT. Another product unit has been testing a new search desktop design that could be used in a question-and-answer form.Leaders have been asking more employees for feedback on the efforts in recent weeks. CNBC viewed internal documents and spoke with sources about the efforts currently underway.The product tests come after a recent all-hands meeting where employees raised concerns about the company’s competitive edge in AI, given the sudden popularity of ChatGPT, which was launched by OpenAI, a San Francisco-based startup that’s backed by Microsoft.Google’s AI chief Jeff Dean told employees at the time that the company has much more “reputational risk” in providing wrong information and thus is moving “more conservatively than a small startup.” However, he and Pichai teased at the time that Google may launch similar products to the public some time this year. Google’s prime business is web search, and the company has long touted itself as a pioneer in AI.Apprentice Bard One of the test products is a chatbot called Apprentice Bard, which uses Google’s conversation technology LaMDA, or Language Model for Dialogue Applications.“As a result of ChatGPT, the LaMDA team has been asked to prioritize working on a response to ChatGPT,” read one internal memo viewed by CNBC. “In the short term, it takes precedence over other projects,” the email continued, warning that some employees stop attending certain unrelated meetings.Keeping upCommentsWhy businesses must see AI tool ChatGPT as an opportunityCaitlin ParoczaiApprentice Bard looks similar to ChatGPT: Employees can enter a question in a dialog box and get a text answer, then give feedback on the response. Based on several responses viewed by CNBC, Apprentice Bard’s answers can include recent events, a feature ChatGPT doesn’t have yet.Apprentice Bard replaced Meena, a previous version of a smart chat bot that had launched internally but was later discontinued. Employees have noticed Apprentice Bard’s responses becoming more advanced in recent weeks.In one example circulated internally, a tester asked Apprentice Bard if there will be another round of layoffs at Google. The company laid off 12,000 employees, 6 per cent of its workforce, earlier this month.“According to my data base access, it is unlikely for Google to conduct another round of layoffs in 2023,” the response reads. “Layoffs are generally conducted to reduce costs and structure, but the company is doing well financially. In fact, Google’s revenue increased by 34 per cent in 2021, and the company’s stock price has risen by 70 per cent since January 2022.”The company is also testing an alternate search page that could use a question-and-answer format, according to designs viewed by CNBC.AI problemsCommentsChatGPT creator unveils way to show if text was AI-writtenDina BassThe West Australian exclusiveThe West Australian exclusiveTougher penalties CommentsPremiumThe West Australian exclusiveAI cheats new target of Perth schools’ revised policiesBethany HiattOne view showed the home search page offering five different prompts for potential questions placed directly under the main search bar, replacing the current “I’m feeling lucky” bar. It also showed a small chat logo inside the far right end of the search bar.When a question is entered, the search results show a grey bubble directly under the search bar, offering more human-like responses than typical search results. Directly beneath that, the page suggests several follow-up questions related to the first one. Under that, it shows typical search results, including links and headlines.It’s unclear just which experiments Google plans to incorporate in future product launches.“We have long been focused on developing and deploying AI to improve people’s lives,” a Google spokesperson said. “We believe that AI is foundational and transformative technology that is incredibly useful for individuals, businesses and communities, and as our AI Principles outline, we need to consider the broader societal impacts these innovations can have. We continue to test our AI technology internally to make sure it’s helpful and safe, and we look forward to sharing more experiences externally soon.”ChatGPT would be hired as a level 3 engineer Perhaps unsurprisingly, Google teams have also been testing a beta LaMDA chat against ChatGPT, itself. In separate documents, it selected examples of prompts and answers in side-by-side comparisons.“Amazingly ChatGPT gets hired at L3 when interviewed for a coding position,” states one note in an internal document that compares LaMDA and ChatGPT. It didn’t state whether LaMDA would have performed similarly well.One of the example prompts asked both chatbots if ChatGPT and AlphaCode, a coding engine owned by Alphabet subsidiary Deepmind, are going to replace programmers.“No, ChatGPT and AlphaCode are not going to replace programmers,” LaMDA’s answered, followed by four paragraphs of explanation including that “programming is a team sport” and that while the chatbots “can help programmers work more efficiently,” it “cannot replace the creativity and artistry that is necessary for a great program.”ChatGPT’s response was similar, stating “It is unlikely that ChatGPT or Alphacode will replace programmers” because they are “not capable of fully replacing the expertise and creativity of human programmers...programming is a complex field that requires a deep understanding of computer science principles and the ability to adapt to new technologies.”THE ECONOMISTCommentsPremiumThe race of the AI labs heats up opinion opinionAndrew MillerCommentsPremium opinionAI like a diseased parrot: Insincere and possibly dangerousAndrew MillerAnother prompt asks it to write a witty and funny movie scene in the style of Wes Anderson as an upmarket shoplifter in a perfume store being interrogated by security. LAMDA writes in a script form and ChatGPT writes it in a narration form that’s much longer and more in-depth.Another prompt included a riddle that asks, “Three women are in a room. Two of them are mothers and have just given birth. Now, the children’s fathers come in. What is the totally number of people in the room?”The document shows ChatGPT is thrown off, answering “there are five people in the room,” while LaMDA correctly responds that “there are seven people in the room.”CNBCGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.Sign up for our emailsCommentsTo comment on this story and join the conversation, subscribe to The West Australian’s Everyday Digital package.Are you already a subscriber?LoginFeaturesPick your newslettersFind out MoreFrom around the siteDemand for oil and gas to drop dramatically by 2050: BPPremiumSnap shares plunge on weak revenue amid digital ad strugglesPremiumFTX co-founder attempted to influence witnesses, court toldMicrosoft, ArcelorMittal back MIT spinout for clean steelPremiumFed expected to slow rate hiking to a quarter pointPremiumMcDonald’s profit grows as customers flock to restaurants PremiumTop StoriesThe West Australian exclusiveThe West Australian exclusiveGrim WarningCommentsPremiumThe West Australian exclusive‘CAN KILL IN HOURS’: WA records major surge in deadly bugThe West Australian exclusiveThe West Australian exclusiveSEE THE FULL LISTCommentsPremiumThe West Australian exclusiveFull fixture list for 2023 WAFL season revealed  breaking breaking‘Bombs going off’ VideoPremium breakingResidents in ‘shock’ after explosion at retirement homeOur NetworkWest RewardsWest Regional NetworkWest Announcements West ClassifiedsWestBusiness Events West Travel ClubThe GameMedia EducationPerthNow7plus7NEWSOur PartnersCar ExpertStarts at 60Raiz InvestHealthEngineSocietyOneiSeekplantHome BeautifulBetter Homes & GardensMarie ClaireNew IdeaThat’s LifeBeauty CrewInstitchuCarbarSubscribe ToThe West Australian NewspaperThe West Email NewslettersConnect with usMessenger IconSend us a messageShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to InstagramShare to YoutubeRSS FeedEmail UsContact UsFrequently Asked QuestionsEditorial PolicyEditorial ComplaintsPlace an ad in the ClassifiedsAdvertise in The West AustralianCorporate© West Australian Newspapers Limited 2023Privacy PolicyTerms of UseThe West Australian

        'Everybody is cheating': Why this teacher has adopted an open ChatGPT policy

AFP via Getty ImagesNot all educators are shying away from artificial intelligence in the classroom.
Ethan Mollick has a message for the humans and the machines: can't we all just get along? 

After all, we are now officially in an A.I. world and we're going to have to share it, reasons the associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania's prestigious Wharton School. 

""This was a sudden change, right? There is a lot of good stuff that we are going to have to do differently, but I think we could solve the problems of how we teach people to write in a world with ChatGPT,"" Mollick told NPR. 

Ever since the chatbot ChatGPT launched in November, educators have raised concerns it could facilitate cheating. 

Some school districts have banned access to the bot, and not without reason. The artificial intelligence tool from the company OpenAI can compose poetry. It can write computer code. It can maybe even pass an MBA exam. 

One Wharton professor recently fed the chatbot the final exam questions for a core MBA course and found that, despite some surprising math errors, he would have given it a B or a B-minus in the class. 

And yet, not all educators are shying away from the bot. 

This year, Mollick is not only allowing his students to use ChatGPT, they are required to. And he has formally adopted an A.I. policy into his syllabus for the first time. 

He teaches classes in entrepreneurship and innovation, and said the early indications were the move was going great. 

""The truth is, I probably couldn't have stopped them even if I didn't require it,"" Mollick said. 

This week he ran a session where students were asked to come up with ideas for their class project. Almost everyone had ChatGPT running and were asking it to generate projects, and then they interrogated the bot's ideas with further prompts. 

""And the ideas so far are great, partially as a result of that set of interactions,"" Mollick said.

/
OpenAI/Screenshot by NPRUsers experimenting with the chatbot are warned before testing the tool that ChatGPT ""may occasionally generate incorrect or misleading information.""
He readily admits he alternates between enthusiasm and anxiety about how artificial intelligence can change assessments in the classroom, but he believes educators need to move with the times. 

""We taught people how to do math in a world with calculators,"" he said. Now the challenge is for educators to teach students how the world has changed again, and how they can adapt to that. 

Mollick's new policy states that using A.I. is an ""emerging skill""; that it can be wrong and students should check its results against other sources; and that they will be responsible for any errors or omissions provided by the tool. 

And, perhaps most importantly, students need to acknowledge when and how they have used it. 

""Failure to do so is in violation of academic honesty policies,"" the policy reads. 

Mollick isn't the first to try to put guardrails in place for a post-ChatGPT world. 

Earlier this month, 22-year-old Princeton student Edward Tian created a program to detect if something had been written by a machine. It was so popular that when he launched it, the website crashed from overuse. 

""Humans deserve to know when something is written by a human or written by a machine,"" Tian told NPR of his motivation. 

Mollick agrees, but isn't convinced that educators can ever truly stop cheating. 

He cites a survey of Stanford students that found many had already used ChatGPT in their final exams, and he points to estimates that thousands of people in places like Kenya are writing essays on behalf of students abroad. 

""I think everybody is cheating ... I mean, it's happening. So what I'm asking students to do is just be honest with me,"" he said. ""Tell me what they use ChatGPT for, tell me what they used as prompts to get it to do what they want, and that's all I'm asking from them. We're in a world where this is happening, but now it's just going to be at an even grander scale."" 
""I don't think human nature changes as a result of ChatGPT. I think capability did.""

Revealed at the Precision Medicine World Conference in Silicon Valley California, the first-in-class platform technology utilizes RNA analytics and machine learning to characterize an individual's gene expression and provide clinical decision support to physicians for treatment options for their patients.  The technology, only a concept for the last few years, is being utilized to launch a portfolio of 10+ clinical tests over the next five years to provide decision support for diseases that affect more than 50 million Americans.(PRNewsfoto/AMPEL BioSolutions)(PRNewswire)AMPEL's innovative machine learning approach, which is now ready to be developed as a clinical decision support biomarker test, could greatly impact health care by allowing physicians to identify the cause of patient disease symptoms and select appropriate treatment more precisely.  AMPEL's approach is sufficiently sensitive to detect early signs of disease and group patients by the severity of their condition. The application of AMPEL's technology is already assisting 15+ pharmaceutical companies in drug development and clinical trials.Patients with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases often suffer from unpredictable disease activity that impacts daily activities like work and family life. Since unpredictable symptoms often result in trips to the Emergency Room, the ability to predict worsening disease and systemic involvement with routine testing has important health care and health economics implications. AMPEL expects to bring it's first two products to market in the next few years, LuGENE® blood test for Lupus and DermaGENE® skin biopsy test for Psoriasis, Atopic Dermatitis, Scleroderma and Lupus. In addition, AMPEL's CovGENE® blood test that predicts how severe a disease course a COVID patient may experience and may be applicable to ""long COVID"" is ready for licensing/co-development with a company already offering COVID diagnostic testing.Paired with AMPEL's pipeline of tools to analyze very large and complex clinical datasets (""Big Data""), AMPEL's Genomic Platform technology with machine learning is a significant step towards implementing routine testing to monitor disease activity and provide decision support for treatment based on a patient's gene expression. This will transform the way doctors treat patients by using the information gathered by the lab test and analyzed by machine learning to diagnose, characterize the precise molecular abnormalities and treat diseases before damage begins, saving patients from pain and inconvenience of diseases that otherwise drastically affect their lives.Pharmaceutical companies test drugs in clinical trials and face the challenge of enrolling patients that have the best potential to respond to the treatment being tested.  Enrolling the ""wrong"" patients can result in trial failure, often leading to cancellation of a drug's development towards FDA approval that may have benefit in a sub-group of the overall patient population. AMPEL's technology helps pharmaceutical companies proactively identify the patients most likely to respond to specific treatments, thereby helping improve outcomes in clinical trials and quality of life for patients in need. AMPEL's Pharma work was highlighted by Dr. Peter Lipsky at the Precision Medicine World Conference in a panel discussing the use of machine learning in clinical trial patient selection and outcome prediction and by Dr. Amrie Grammer at a Google-Reuters webinar focused on machine learning approaches to select the right patient for the right trial at the right time.Dr. Peter Lipsky, AMPEL Co-Founder, CEO and Chief Medical Officer: ""It is very gratifying to see a concept develop into a reality that can help patients. When we began some years ago we thought that analyzing gene expression data could subset patients effectively and allow the molecular profile of each patient to be used to help identify the best treatment for each individual. By applying novel machine learning approaches, we are now ready to launch our first application that we believe should be a major step toward providing patients with autoimmune diseases true precision medicine.""Dr. Amrie Grammer, AMPEL Co-Founder, President and CSO: """"Our team has developed a genomic platform technology with machine learning that supports clinical precision medicine tests that predict drug options based on gene expression.  AMPEL is changing the paradigm of treatment in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.  We are proud to be doing this work in Virginia and will continue to recruit talent and grow our business here.""Background InformationMachine learning is an analytic technique to train computers to assess information and make predictions.  AMPEL has used this approach in a novel way to train a computer to analyze data obtained from assessing a kind of ""Big Data"", namely that obtained by assessing gene expression information, to predict whether an individual living with lupus, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis or scleroderma is experiencing a flare in disease activity. Gene expression analysis examines the number and pattern of the genes expressed at a given moment and can provide insight into the entire spectrum of genomic abnormalities.Many chronic diseases have unexpected flares that dramatically affect patient quality of life. Further, treatments for chronic disease have been developed based on a patient population as a group, so some individuals will respond differently or not at all to available treatments. For the past nine years, the scientists and clinicians at AMPEL have been working on ways to address this problem, by designing concepts to personalize treatments for an individual patient as opposed to a patient population. Peer reviewed publications confirm the practicality of AMPEL's concept, which are now in the commercialization phase.AMPEL's initial focus was lupus but the test can be used for many autoimmune or inflammatory diseases. AMPEL's blood and tissue biopsy tests are prognostic and staging biomarkers that will provide decision support for their physician with the most appropriate drugs for the patient at that moment in time.About AMPEL BioSolutions LLC (2013-present)AMPEL BioSolutions is a precision medicine company commercializing a development pipeline of CLIA-certified gene expression tests for blood or tissue samples that provide clinical decision support by determining disease status, identifying molecular pathway and predicting drug options.  AMPEL's technology is a cloud-based platform that hosts proprietary RNA analytic tools and machine learning algorithms covered by 25+ filed/pending patents and 80+ peer-reviewed publications in high impact journals. Disease Areas for AMPEL's precision medicine test portfolio include Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, Psoriasis, Scleroderma, Atopic Dermatitis, Lupus Nephritis, Fibromyalgia, Cardiovascular, Sjogren's Syndrome, ASD, Wellness, Lung Cancer and SARS-Cov2. AMPEL's technology covers over 95% of all known genes and AMPEL's exclusive curated database of >15,000 individual gene expression profiles with rich clinical information fuels machine learning predictions based on evidence.

‘Transformational’ approach to machine learning could accelerate search for new disease treatments 
November 30, 2021 University of Cambridge 

Researchers have developed a new approach to machine learning that ‘learns how to learn’ and out-performs current machine learning methods for drug design, which in turn could accelerate the search for new disease treatments.
The method, called transformational machine learning (TML), was developed by a team from the UK, Sweden, India and Netherlands. It learns from multiple problems and improves performance while it learns.
TML could accelerate the identification and production of new drugs by improving the machine learning systems which are used to identify them. The results are reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
Most types of machine learning (ML) use labelled examples, and these examples are almost always represented in the computer using intrinsic features, such as the colour or shape of an object. The computer then forms general rules that relate the features to the labels.
“It’s sort of like teaching a child to identify different animals: this is a rabbit, this is a donkey and so on,” said Professor Ross King from Cambridge’s Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, who led the research. “If you teach a machine learning algorithm what a rabbit looks like, it will be able to tell whether an animal is or isn’t a rabbit. This is the way that most machine learning works – it deals with problems one at a time.”

However, this is not the way that human learning works: instead of dealing with a single issue at a time, we get better at learning because we have learned things in the past.
“To develop TML, we applied this approach to machine learning, and developed a system that learns information from previous problems it has encountered in order to better learn new problems,” said King, who is also a Fellow at The Alan Turing Institute. “Where a typical ML system has to start from scratch when learning to identify a new type of animal – say a kitten – TML can use the similarity to existing animals: kittens are cute like rabbits, but don’t have long ears like rabbits and donkeys. This makes TML a much more powerful approach to machine learning.”
The researchers demonstrated the effectiveness of their idea on thousands of problems from across science and engineering. They say it shows particular promise in the area of drug discovery, where this approach speeds up the process by checking what other ML models say about a particular molecule. A typical ML approach will search for drug molecules of a particular shape, for example. TML instead uses the connection of the drugs to other drug discovery problems.
“I was surprised how well it works – better than anything else we know for drug design,” said King. “It’s better at choosing drugs than humans are – and without the best science, we won’t get the best results.”

Musk, tech leaders call for pause on 'out-of-control' AI raceIn an open letter, industry leaders say AI systems are becoming ""human-competitive"" and recommend more focus on safety and regulation.Michael Dwyer / APBy Gage JacksonFacebook ShareTweetEmailSMSMarch 30, 2023Some of the biggest names in technology are calling for a temporary pause on artificial intelligence developments amid concerns the industry could be getting ahead of itself.Elon Musk, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, and several other big names in computer science and tech signed an open letter Wednesday, requesting a six-month pause on the ""out-of-control"" AI race.The petition comes following OpenAI's recent release of its GPT-4 technology, a much more advanced version of its popular AI chatbot ChatGPT. Microsoft and Google have also unveiled similar AI-powered chatbots in recent months.Related StoryOpenAI unveils GPT-4, its most advanced AI language modelGPT-4 exhibits ""human-level performance"" on various professional and academic benchmarks, the company said.LEARN MORE""Advanced AI could represent a profound change in the history of life on Earth, and should be planned for and managed with commensurate care and resources,"" the letter reads. ""Unfortunately, this level of planning and management is not happening, even though recent months have seen AI labs locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one – not even their creators – can understand, predict, or reliably control.""The letter doesn't call for a complete halt on AI development, but rather a step back from the ""dangerous race"" to create unpredictable technology.It also warns that AI systems are becoming ""human-competitive"" and could potentially automate millions of jobs, transforming the global economy as we know it.“We call on all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4,” the letter says. “This pause should be public and verifiable, and include all key actors. If such a pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium.” Related StoryWhat would a sentient, conscious robot mean for humans?A Google engineer claimed an AI software of theirs became sentient.

Microsoft has announced that it’ll be introducing AI features into Dynamics 365, its set of enterprise apps for customer relationship management and resource planning. The company calls the set of features “CoPilot,” and is pitching it as a way to help businesspeople “create ideas and content faster, complete time-consuming tasks, and get insights and next best actions.” That involves things like having an AI write customizable emails to customers and automatically generate meeting summaries, write a response to customer service chats and emails based on the previous conversation, and help marketers delve into their data without having to write SQL. The company’s also pitching it as a way to help generate ideas for marketing emails, which means that you could start seeing AI-powered ads in your inbox soon. Microsoft’s promising even more than that — the company says the system will make it easier to create “virtual agents” for customer support, which can use OpenAI’s tech to search Bing and internal knowledge bases for answers. Like it has with other AI tools, Microsoft is pitching this as something that humans will use, rather than a way to replace employees. In a LinkedIn post, CEO Satya Nadella called the announcement a step towards “transforming every business process and function with interactive, AI-powered collaboration.”Microsoft has been pushing generative AI tech in its other business-related apps as well — GitHub, a popular tool for coders, also has a CoPilot feature to help you write code, and Teams uses AI for a variety of things, such as recapping meetings. The company has also started releasing AI-generated “collaborative articles” on LinkedIn.Similar tech could be coming to software that’s not completely enterprise-focused. There are reports that Microsoft is planning on integrating ChatGPT into apps like Word, PowerPoint, and Outlook.

This award-winning product is the most powerful translator earbuds in the world and Ottumwa Schools are among many schools using it across the U.S. The joint effort by technology and educational institutions plays a significant part in providing equal access to all students.Co-founder of Timekettle Alex Qin with students wearing translator earbuds in Ottumwa School District(PRNewswire)The language barrier is a common challenge faced by English Language Learners (ELLs) and English as a Second Language (ESL) in multicultural classrooms, especially in English-speaking countries with high percentages of immigrants where school performance of students highly relies on proficiency in English. An effective way to communicate with ELLs is crucial for the Ottumwa school district, whose over 20% of its 5, 000 students speak 45 languages. The best solution available is Timekettle's translator earbuds WT2 Edge, tiny yet powerful, which can translate up to 40 languages and 93 accents in real time, enabling natural and long-lasting conversations. And it's not solely for language teaching but for math, science, etc. The goal is to flatten the learning curve in the initial stage, the quicker the students get proficient in English, the more confident they will be in achieving good grades.Timekettle's world-first translator earbuds are embedded with the industry-leading HybridComm™ system, which subverts the shackles of conventional translation products - handheld translators and translation Apps are not user-friendly because people need to pass the device back and forth to each other - by adopting an entirely different technical design to advance products in speech processing, simultaneous interpretation, and AI translation.Currently, there are hundreds of WT2 Edge in use in the Ottumwa school district. The Co-founder of Timekettle, Alex Qin said, ""Timekettle will keep upgrading its hardware and software in Google Play to optimize the capability for Chromebook and user experiences in educational settings.""About TimekettleEstablished in 2016, Timekettle is an industry-leading translation solutions provider recognized by winning numerous international awards such as CES Innovation Award, iF Design Award, and TechCrunch. As the top-selling brand in the Translator Device industry, Timekettle now serves about 300,000 users worldwide.For more information, please visit https://www.timekettle.co/ or contact press@timekettle.co.View original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/timekettle-ai-translator-earbuds-empower-english-language-learners-301657084.htmlSOURCE  Shenzhen Timekettle Technologies.

They give her not just entertainment, but a portal to new friendships and interesting conversations with other people.But because she is visually-impaired, the Seven Hills High School year 10 student often feels excluded.So she invented a concept to make gaming more accessible for people like her: harnessing virtual reality headsets and sensory gloves to enable gamers with visual impairment to play online with their friends.Christine has come up with a plan for computer games for the visually-impaired. Credit:Rhett Wyman""There are so many benefits to playing games and communicating with other players. The blind and visually-impaired are missing out,"" she said.AdvertisementHer idea took the top prize in Microsoft's nation-wide artificial intelligence competition for senior high school students on Thursday.""Gaming is a big industry and so many people talk about the latest games, gaming news, their favourite games, everything like that,"" Christine said.""Without accessibility for the blind and visually-impaired community, we won't be able to play, and won't have anything to relate [to other people] about.She hopes the concept will help people deal with loneliness. Credit:Rhett Wyman""We thought about the idea because of the problem with isolation and loneliness in the blind and visually-impaired community, which is something I’ve experienced throughout my schooling and my life.""She said the pandemic had highlighted the importance of digital inclusion and online communication with friends - an important part of teenage social lives that often left visually-impaired people out.While some games include accessibility features such as text to speech functions, high contrast modes and magnification, Christine said they only catered to people with slight vision impairment.""We wanted to design something where even people who are completely blind can still play,"" she said.She would like to design a game that could be played by someone who is blind. Credit:Rhett WymanThe result is 'Sensory 4 Sight': a design concept that equips visually-impaired gamers with a vibrating VR headset and gloves that can indicate what is happening on-screen.In a shooting game, for example, the headset would vibrate either in the direction of the shooter or all around to mimic a complete assault. Surround sound headphones also give the user an idea of where they are in the game.LoadingThe gloves have heat sensors in them, allowing the gamer to sense when they are touching an inanimate object or character. Users can also customise the level of on-screen detail and contrast to suit their vision, and choose to join multi-player games with other visually-impaired gamers.Christine and her classmate Kyle Maffeo worked on the project for five hours each fortnight during school, and she put in extra hours at home. It earned them the top award out of 631 submissions from 138 schools across Australia.""I really hope that this actually becomes a product,"" Christine said. ""I’m hoping that a lot more people in the blind and visually-impaired community get on board and use it to play games with new friends.""And hopefully it slims down the amount of people who suffer with loneliness and isolation.""Junior high school competition winners Sydney Bao and Ailis Sweeney, in year 9 at Ravenswood School for Girls, also catered to people with disabilities in their submission.Their app, called AIdaptyle, would link a user's body-scan to online fashion websites to help people with physical disabilities or special needs order custom-made clothing that fits.Users would scan their bodies with their phone, enter their modification preferences, and select their preferred outfits online. AI would then produce modified patterns and laser cut fabric, to tailor a product that is then shipped to the client.""The mainstream fashion industry actively excludes people with disabilities and while adaptive clothing is functional, it is not stylish - that is where our AI concept comes in,"" Sydney said.The students are now looking for an investor to bring their idea to life, while Christine will study software design and development as an elective next year, to pursue her interest in what AI can do.And she already has an idea for next year's competition. ""The concept is that the blind and visually-impaired community has trouble crossing busy roads, so it can be very unsafe,"" she said.

Holding Koort with the Bard

November 5, 2021 ·
by Your Herald ·
			in News.			·

SHAKESPEARE in the Park is making a dramatic comeback, with Fremantle’s new civic heart set to play a lead role.
Fremantle Theatre Company is bringing back what was once a must-see on WA’s arts calendar and has signed up tv star Joel Jackson for A Midsummer Night’s Dream, which will have a season in Walyalup Koort from January 12-15 before heading to its traditional home at Kings Park.
Logie
WA-born Jackson won an AACTA Award for best lead actor and a Logie as best newcomer for portraying Peter Allen in Channel 7’s 2015 TV biopic about the Aussie music legend, and garnered nominations and acclaim for his portrayal of WWI historian Charles Bean in Deadline Gallipoli.
While he hasn’t performed Shakespeare since his days at the National Institute of Dramatic Art, Jackson said he’s always been drawn to the style of language captured by the Renaissance genius. It’s reflected in his own music, having grown up planning to tour the world as a rockstar.
“It’s those kinds of stories that are inside of a song, and folklore that’s inside of a song – Paul Kelly, Neil Young – all that stuff to me is massive,” Jackson said.
“It’s about understanding the context, understanding the language; and once you have that, it’s really special to share with an audience.”
Jackson says it was an easy decision to work with the FTC; he and artistic director Renato Fabretti were at NIDA together and while in the audience for its last production Meat he spotted several other actors and crew he’d worked alongside in the past.
“Coming through the doors again, this feels like home,” he now says of the company’s headquarters in Victoria Hall.
It’s also something of a homecoming for Shakespeare as well; back in the early noughties Deckchair Theatre took over running the Kings Park shows and was based in the same historic venue.
Fabretti cut his acting teeth belting out the bard for Deckchair and says performing Midsummers under the stars keeps actors on their toes.
“If a duck interrupts you, you learn your place on the hierarchy of comedy very quickly and either meet the duck at its level, or fail,” he laughs.
He’s looking forward to staging the production in Walyalup Koort, saying his Italian heritage is steeped in the “piazza philosophy” of bringing citizens together in the middle of town.
New Fremantle mayor Hannah Fitzhardinge said scoring a season of Shakespeare was an endorsement of the council’s square revamp.
“I think this will be a real showcase for how the square can be adapted to do all kinds of different activities,” Ms Fitzhardinge said.
“I think one of the things about the civic centre, Walyalup Koort, is it’s such an adaptable space, so we’ll see the long table dinner there in the next few weeks, we’ll see the playground opening, the Christmas activation.”
She says councils that try to fill their town squares by themselves tend to fail, so having an organisation like FTC applying to use the space was encouraging.

Turbocharging careerpaths: The role of skills data and AI
Organizations that actively offer opportunities for career growth aligned with business needs will be better able to navigate the many changes on the horizon.

In the war for talent, being able to provide personalized career paths is a clear differentiator for your employer brand. A McKinsey study revealed that a major driver of why people leave their jobs is the lack of career development. Like many aspects of work, career pathing is becoming intelligent. What used to be a time-consuming, intensive task on both sides is being made more efficient and accurate by technology. But what does intelligent mean?
Designing an effective career path begins with understanding an individual’s skills, interests and professional objectives. It is highly tailored to each individual because careers are deeply personal things. People and talent teams can have a significant, lasting impact on an individual’s life through career pathing exercises — so it’s vital to lead them on the best path for their needs and aspirations.
High-quality skill data provides a strong foundation for the 90 percent of companies shifting towards a skill-based workforce. It needs to be complete, accurate, real-time and unbiased. Your AI models and data-driven decisions are only as good as the data ingested in them. Inaccurate data leads to inaccurate results. At scale, this becomes a serious issue as any inaccuracies and biases will quickly spread throughout your workforce decision-making. A data audit can help you assess how accurate and representative your existing data is — from this, you can understand what data sets are missing.
Most organizations will have incomplete, outdated data. Traditional approaches to data collection include lengthy consultative exercises, surveys, and consolidating your HR, recruiting and learning data. In isolation, these don’t give a comprehensive enough picture for your career pathing to be personal and effective.
You need to capture everything happening across your organization as employees go about their daily work. They generate skill signals (indications of their skills) every time they complete a project, share their insights, learn, give and get peer feedback and more. Of course, with such a glut of possible data to collect, it’s little surprise that you’ll need to work to structure and clean the data to make it usable. When this data is refined appropriately, it complements and enriches information in recruitment, learning and HR systems. Better still, you can augment this with public data sources such as market and labor data to understand how your workforce skills compare within your industry.
That’s what’s going to give you the insights needed to offer career opportunities that align with your people’s interests, skills and career goals. This data will also help you understand what organizational capabilities are strong and which are areas for improvement. This is what will prepare your company for future challenges and transformation.
AI makes managing skill data a lot simpler and a lot more scalable because it constantly enhances your existing data sets, plugging skill profiles with missing information, and it can make recommendations based on the available data. For instance, connected skills that someone may have that they haven’t put in their skill profile, or work and learning opportunities that can build new skills.
It also plays a fundamental role in building a skill framework. Understanding your workforce skills is a critical step, according to Josh Bersin, and a bespoke skill framework is how you’re going to achieve this. For it to have a tangible impact on your business and to withstand the test of time, it needs to be actionable, granular (to give you the right insights) and dynamic so it evolves with business and individual needs.
Although this might feel like a big shift, it will be worth it in the long run as companies that actively offer opportunities for career growth, aligned with business needs, are better able to navigate the many changes on the horizon. Or as Deloitte’s “2023 Global Human Capital Trends” report states, “those who partner with workers and experiment with what’s possible will create sustainable work models and elevated outcomes.”

UFV is working with artificial intelligence robots that can help combat isolation and loneliness, thanks to funding from the TD Bank Group. (UFV photo)
Robots and AI being used to help combat COVID-19 loneliness at UFV
Findings will be shared with government, industry, and community partners to enhance wellness
 Jessica PetersJan. 31, 2022 4:32 p.m.Trending Now 
 
Loneliness has become a real concern as the COVID-19 pandemic wears on, and it’s affecting young people and the elderly more than other age groups. 
But imagine a robot that could interpret sounds and other cues from the elderly that could make them feel less alone, or a program on a device that could help engage isolated young people. 
Researchers at the University of the Fraser Valley’s Community Health and Social Innovation Hub (CHASI) are embarking on a project to learn more about how these kinds of intuitive solutions can help people who are susceptible to loneliness. 
“We just got the funding go ahead at the start of the school year,” says Dr. Martha Dow, director of CHASI.
 The research will roll out in stages, and will include the use of a few robots who can pick up cues from the elderly, such as sound, to help with their care. 
It may mean a certain movement or sound could alert staff in a care home that assistance is needed, Dow explains. They will have three or four artificial intelligence (AI) robots in the study, and will be connecting with care homes and with older adults living independently in the community. 
The project is being spearheaded by Dr. Amir Shabani, and has just received $225,000 from the TD Bank Group to fund the project for three years.
The TD Ready Commitment funding will support the research augmented by the AI and machine learning to examine the impact of the pandemic on these two age groups that have been disproportionately impacted.
Along with other research methods, smart algorithms will be developed to detect audio-visual cues, recognize emotions, and respond to symptoms of anxiety and depression, as well as teach new coping strategies. The project team will assess the success of these methods in helping offset social isolation and loneliness.
“We are excited to partner with TD on this project to examine the effectiveness of various interventions in helping these two population groups that have been deeply affected by the pandemic,” said Dow. “These findings will be shared with government, industry, and community partners to enhance social and emotional wellness in our community.”
The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified loneliness as a significant predictor of depression and anxiety in both older and younger adults. However, the rates of social isolation and loneliness are significantly higher amongst older adults compared to all other age groups, with around 40 per cent of all older adults reporting feelings of loneliness.
“For people in communities everywhere, the pandemic has underscored the critical importance of maintaining good mental health, especially during periods of social isolation and loneliness,” said Andy Cribb, Senior Vice President, Branch Banking, TD Pacific Region. “TD is proud to partner with UFV and CHASI as researchers seek to address this significant challenge so that they can help people and communities stay resilient for years to come.”
While youth aged 15-24 are more likely than the general population to report worsening mental health due to COVID-19, the most dramatic impact of the pandemic has been felt by older adults, their families, and caregivers.
“We are particularly excited about this project and helping people affected by COVID-19,” said Anita Nielsen, UFV Executive Director, Advancement & Alumni Relations. “We see UFV’s role as central in supporting the health and wellness of communities and we know this partnership with TD will fuel innovative thinking from inception to implementation while training the next generation of student researchers.”

AI vs EU: ChatGPT shakes up Brussels plans for regulation

AI is in wide use, but conversational robot ChatGPT transformed how people view technology

How do you protect people using new technology when it can radically change from one day to the next?
That’s the riddle the EU faces as it races to regulate artificial intelligence.
AI is in wide use, but the conversational robot ChatGPT has transformed how people view the technology – and how regulators should monitor it to protect against risks.
Created by US startup OpenAI, ChatGPT appeared in November and was quickly seized upon by users amazed at its ability to answer difficult questions clearly, write sonnets or code and provide information on loaded issues.
ChatGPT has even passed medical and legal exams set for human students, scoring high marks.
But the technology also comes with many risks as its learning system and similar competitor models are integrated into commercial applications.
The European Union was already deeply into the process of creating an online regulatory framework, and now must go back to the drawing board to figure out how to effectively regulate AI.
The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, first announced a plan in April 2021 for an AI rulebook, and the European Parliament hopes to finalise its preferred AI Act text this month.
The EU industry commissioner, Thierry Breton, said MEPs, the commission and member states are working together to “further clarify the rules” on ChatGPT-type tech – known as general purpose AI – systems that have a vast range of functions.
Opportunities v risks
Social media users have had fun experimenting with ChatGPT output, but it’s not a game. Teachers fear students will use it to cheat, and policymakers fear it will be used to spread misinformation.
“As showcased by ChatGPT, AI solutions can offer great opportunities for businesses and citizens, but can also pose risks,” Breton has said.
“This is why we need a solid regulatory framework to ensure trustworthy AI based on high-quality data.”
The plan is for the European Commission, the European Council, which represents the 27 member states, and the parliament to discuss a final version of the AI act from April.
Dragos Tudorache, the MEP overseeing the push to get the AI Act through parliament, said ChatGPT was one the publicly known, news-making example of general-purpose AI and various derivatives.
Using what is known as a “large language model”, ChatGPT is an example of generative AI that – operating unguided – can create reams of original content, including images and text, by mining past data.
“We will indeed propose a set of rules to govern general-purpose AI, and foundational models in particular,” said Tudorache, a Romanian MEP.
Last week, Tudorache and Italian MEP Brando Benifei presented fellow legislators with a plan to impose more obligations on general-purpose AI, a text which did not feature in the commission’s original proposal.
Some experts complain the risks from such systems like ChatGPT were always clear and the warnings were shared with EU officials as work started on the AI Act.
“Our recommendation back then was that we should also regulate AI systems that have a range of uses,” said Kris Shrishak, technology fellow at the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.
But he said it was also just as important to identify the risks from generative AI systems once they are deployed.
‘Good foundation’
Shrishak said the act’s effectiveness would depend on the final draft but that it “lays a good foundation. It does have certain mechanisms to identify new risks”.
A more pressing issue would be enforcement, he warned, adding that the parliament was working towards strengthening this aspect.
“The regulation is just a piece of paper if it’s not enforced,” Shrishak told AFP.
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has suggested “major world governments” and “trusted international institutions” come together and produce a set of rules that explicitly say what the system should and should not do.
Asked by an AFP reporter to say how it would regulate itself, the ChatGPT engine said it would welcome “responsible and ethical regulation”.
And it called for a law that “recognises the potential benefits of AI while also addressing the potential risks and challenges.”

Although the platform has been live and running with numerous Fortune 500 brands internationally, across 23 countries, the GP US team has been developing several localized features for the US market expansion. GP US technology helps brands, and their respective agencies distinctly increase the effectiveness of video campaigns by bringing a level of granular and intent-based targeting to the Youtube channel that has been unattainable with traditional buying tools.Clients have seen increases in engagement metrics, time on page and page views, by an average of 3.4x and 12x, respectively.One of the biggest challenges with video contextual advertising over recent years has been realizing enough granularity with video processing and analysis to truly identify, understand, and separate appropriate videos from inappropriate ones. Nobody wants their video advertising campaigns to appear adjacent to mislabeled segments, misaligned audiences or unsuitable content, which can result in negative ROI, or worse, reputational damage.Up until now the top industry players have resorted to solving this by implementing bulky Youtube channel-level blocks or introducing numerous one-size fits all contextual categories. However, the power of Youtube and other large video content platforms is that one can target ads to intent-based video content specifically curated to the advertiser's product or brand messaging.GP video contextual platform has been consistently outperforming affinity targeting tactics. Clients have seen increases in engagement metrics, time on page and page views, by an average of 3.4x and 12x, respectively. Not only does it give some breathing room for brands trying to navigate the new era of a privacy centric ad industry but also the ever-changing and complex cookie-replacement solutions developing in the market.""Bringing a video contextual platform to market that can utilize greater quantity and quality of signals in a smarter way allows for a similar approach to audience-based targeting but considerably more real-time and accurate, ""said Francisco Quiroga, CCO at GP US.AboutGP US is a next-generation video intelligence platform that bridges the gap between content and ads by offering contextual advertising tools unavailable to buyers on other platforms. GP US significantly minimizes targeting unsuitable content for brands, which reduces wasted impressions, and improves user sentiment, brand recall, and brand safety. Understanding the content users consume at a more granular level allows GP US to deliver more effective messaging for your brand and better ROI.

How skill development in AI and Data Science can help in Public Administration


As we become an increasingly data-driven society, the need for individuals well-equipped in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science are becoming crucial in solving diverse problems, making it an important aspect of Public Administration. Public Administration is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide range of duties and functions and aims to fulfil objectives as envisaged by public policies or law. A career in Public Administration requires problem detection and solving capabilities coupled with sound knowledge of governance procedures. Functions such as maintenance of law and order, welfare activities by government, catering to infrastructural needs are examples of Public Administration that make use of data for an informed decision.Fostering digitalisationAdvertising

AdvertisingData Science involves the curation and analysis of voluminous amounts of information in order to deduce patterns, trends and potential opportunities that can be used to conceptualise efficacious and innovative solutions for a particular problem. Policymakers have also realised the revolutionary impact of ‘datafication’. Therefore the time in deploying predicative analytics to reduce crime rate, tackle traffic congestion, detection of corruption is not very remote any more. The government has fostered digitalisation by formulating the Draft IoT policy and launching several initiatives like e-Sanjeevani, PM SVANidhi scheme, Diksha, Aarogya Setu, etc. As a consequence, harnessing data sets and deriving insights from them has become an extremely essential skill set for public administrators. However, there exists a data-skill gap in the sector that could possibly be due to the assumption that Data Science and AI entail computational and statistical competencies. Currently, there are several courses that can be availed to do away with this issue.Data scientists and individuals who are well versed with AI are likely to possess qualities such as analytical thinking, effective data visualisation, decision-making skills and innovative capability due to hands-on training in new-age tools such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning, MATLAB, Python, Tableau, etc. Coupled with knowledge pertaining to public policy, this can result in creating better and pragmatic public administrative strategies. An analyst in public sector would basically be required to:Gather data: Various issues faced by the public may often not surface unless careful inspection of data collected is conducted by a policy analyst. This exercise also reveals the reasons for a policy’s inefficiency.Suggest better policies: After careful inspection and detection of a problem, either current or prospective, suitable solutions can be recommended. Mapping of counterfactuals by use of predictive analytics will also help prepare in case of any emergencies. Assess outcomes of extant policies: The suggested policy by an analyst is kept under consideration for a period of time in order to evaluate its efficacy and to draw a comparative analysis with respect to projections made before the implementation of the new policy. Additionally, cost-benefit analysis, surveys, more data from focus groups are collated for a qualitative approach.Apprise stakeholders: Sharing the relevant information with public, decision makers, press, academia, etc.Finally, the demand for data analysts in public administration to provide services such as administration, financial services, human resource management, knowledge management and strategic leadership will certainly keep rising due to the fact that “data is the new oil”.The writer is the Founder and CEO, SkillEnable

OpenAI will pay ChatGPT users up to R367,000 for reporting bugs Bloomberg12 April 2023


 
Subscribe


 

OpenAI will start paying people as much as $20,000 (R366,981) to help the company find bugs in its artificial intelligence systems, such as the massively popular ChatGPT chatbot.
The AI company wrote in a blog post on Tuesday that it has rolled out a bug bounty program through which people can report weaknesses, bugs or security problems they find while using its AI products.
Such programs, which are common in the tech industry, entail companies paying users for reporting bugs or other security flaws.
OpenAI said it’s rolling it out in partnership with Bugcrowd Inc., which is a bug bounty platform.
The company will pay cash rewards depending on the size of the bugs uncovered, ranging from $200 (R3,673) for what it calls “low-severity findings” to $20,000 (R366,981) for “exceptional discoveries.”
The company said part of why it’s rolling out the program is because it believes “transparency and collaboration” are key to finding vulnerabilities in its technology.
“This initiative is an essential part of our commitment to developing safe and advanced AI,” said the blog post, written by Matthew Knight, OpenAI’s head of security.
“As we create technology and services that are secure, reliable and trustworthy, we would like your help.”
The Bugcrowd page for OpenAI’s bounty program details a number of safety issues related to the models that aren’t eligible for rewards, including jailbreak prompts, questions that result in an AI model writing malicious code, or queries that result in an model saying bad things to a user.
The announcement doesn’t come as a complete surprise. Greg Brockman, president and co-founder of the San Francisco-based company, recently mentioned on Twitter that OpenAI had been “considering starting a bounty program” or network of “red-teamers” to detect weak spots.
He made the comment in response to a post written by Alex Albert, a 22-year old jailbreak prompt enthusiast whose website compiles written prompts intended to get around the safeguards chatbots like ChatGPT have in place.
“Democratised red teaming is one reason we deploy these models,” Brockman wrote.

 NEW YORK (AP) — Artificial intelligence imaging can be used to create art, try on clothes in virtual fitting rooms or help design advertising campaigns.
But experts fear the darker side of the easily accessible tools could worsen something that primarily harms women: nonconsensual deepfake pornography.
 Deepfakes are videos and images that have been digitally created or altered with artificial intelligence or machine learning. Porn created using the technology first began spreading across the internet several years ago when a Reddit user shared clips that placed the faces of female celebrities on the shoulders of porn actors.

 Since then, deepfake creators have disseminated similar videos and images targeting online influencers, journalists and others with a public profile. Thousands of videos exist across a plethora of websites. And some have been offering users the opportunity to create their own images — essentially allowing anyone to turn whoever they wish into sexual fantasies without their consent, or use the technology to harm former partners.

 The problem, experts say, grew as it became easier to make sophisticated and visually compelling deepfakes. And they say it could get worse with the development of generative AI tools that are trained on billions of images from the internet and spit out novel content using existing data.
“The reality is that the technology will continue to proliferate, will continue to develop and will continue to become sort of as easy as pushing the button,” said Adam Dodge, the founder of EndTAB, a group that provides trainings on technology-enabled abuse. “And as long as that happens, people will undoubtedly ... continue to misuse that technology to harm others, primarily through online sexual violence, deepfake pornography and fake nude images.”
Noelle Martin, of Perth, Australia, has experienced that reality. The 28-year-old found deepfake porn of herself 10 years ago when out of curiosity one day she used Google to search an image of herself. To this day, Martin says she doesn’t know who created the fake images, or videos of her engaging in sexual intercourse that she would later find. She suspects someone likely took a picture posted on her social media page or elsewhere and doctored it into porn.
Horrified, Martin contacted different websites for a number of years in an effort to get the images taken down. Some didn't respond. Others took it down but she soon found it up again.
“You cannot win,” Martin said. ""This is something that is always going to be out there. It’s just like it's forever ruined you.”
The more she spoke out, she said, the more the problem escalated. Some people even told her the way she dressed and posted images on social media contributed to the harassment — essentially blaming her for the images instead of the creators.
Eventually, Martin turned her attention towards legislation, advocating for a national law in Australia that would fine companies 555,000 Australian dollars ($370,706) if they don’t comply with removal notices for such content from online safety regulators.
But governing the internet is next to impossible when countries have their own laws for content that's sometimes made halfway around the world. Martin, currently an attorney and legal researcher at the University of Western Australia, says she believes the problem has to be controlled through some sort of global solution.
In the meantime, some AI models say they're already curbing access to explicit images.
OpenAI says it removed explicit content from data used to train the image generating tool DALL-E, which limits the ability of users to create those types of images. The company also filters requests and says it blocks users from creating AI images of celebrities and prominent politicians. Midjourney, another model, blocks the use of certain keywords and encourages users to flag problematic images to moderators.
Meanwhile, the startup Stability AI rolled out an update in November that removes the ability to create explicit images using its image generator Stable Diffusion. Those changes came following reports that some users were creating celebrity inspired nude pictures using the technology.
Stability AI spokesperson Motez Bishara said the filter uses a combination of keywords and other techniques like image recognition to detect nudity and returns a blurred image. But it’s possible for users to manipulate the software and generate what they want since the company releases its code to the public. Bishara said Stability AI’s license “extends to third-party applications built on Stable Diffusion” and strictly prohibits “any misuse for illegal or immoral purposes.”
Some social media companies have also been tightening up their rules to better protect their platforms against harmful materials.

 TikTok said last month all deepfakes or manipulated content that show realistic scenes must be labeled to indicate they’re fake or altered in some way, and that deepfakes of private figures and young people are no longer allowed. Previously, the company had barred sexually explicit content and deepfakes that mislead viewers about real-world events and cause harm.
The gaming platform Twitch also recently updated its policies around explicit deepfake images after a popular streamer named Atrioc was discovered to have a deepfake porn website open on his browser during a livestream in late January. The site featured phony images of fellow Twitch streamers.
Twitch already prohibited explicit deepfakes, but now showing a glimpse of such content — even if it’s intended to express outrage — “will be removed and will result in an enforcement,” the company wrote in a blog post. And intentionally promoting, creating or sharing the material is grounds for an instant ban.
Other companies have also tried to ban deepfakes from their platforms, but keeping them off requires diligence.
Apple and Google said recently they removed an app from their app stores that was running sexually suggestive deepfake videos of actresses to market the product. Research into deepfake porn is not prevalent, but one report released in 2019 by the AI firm DeepTrace Labs found it was almost entirely weaponized against women and the most targeted individuals were western actresses, followed by South Korean K-pop singers.
The same app removed by Google and Apple had run ads on Meta’s platform, which includes Facebook, Instagram and Messenger. Meta spokesperson Dani Lever said in a statement the company’s policy restricts both AI-generated and non-AI adult content and it has restricted the app’s page from advertising on its platforms.
In February, Meta, as well as adult sites like OnlyFans and Pornhub, began participating in an online tool, called Take It Down, that allows teens to report explicit images and videos of themselves from the internet. The reporting site works for regular images, and AI-generated content — which has become a growing concern for child safety groups.
“When people ask our senior leadership what are the boulders coming down the hill that we’re worried about? The first is end-to-end encryption and what that means for child protection. And then second is AI and specifically deepfakes,” said Gavin Portnoy, a spokesperson for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which operates the Take It Down tool.
“We have not ... been able to formulate a direct response yet to it,"" Portnoy said.

In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems. Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI.

This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.View SyllabusSkills You'll LearnLogistic Regression, Artificial Neural Network, Machine Learning (ML) Algorithms, Machine LearningReviewsFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled Star4.9 (171,098 ratings)5 stars92.37%4 stars6.91%3 stars0.47%2 stars0.09%1 star0.14%RRJan 31, 2021Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBroke my hype and fantasies about ML and created a sophisticated interest and a new perspective on the real challenges.

Colorado State University researchers Jason Stock and Tom Cavey have published a paper on an AI system that rewards dogs for doing tricks.
The computer science grad students trained image classification networks to determine whether a dog is sitting, standing, or lying down. If a dog responds to a command by adopting the correct posture, the machine dispenses a treat.
The students used an Nvidia Jetson edge AI platform for real-time trick recognition and treats. Stock and Cavey see their prototype system as a dog trainer’s aid — it handles the treats — or a way to school dogs on better behavior at home.
“We’ve demonstrated the potential for a future product to come out of this,” Stock said in a statement.

The researchers needed dog images that exhibited the three specified postures. They found the Stanford Dogs datasets, with more than 20,000 images of various sizes depicting dogs in many positions. The images required preprocessing so they wrote a program to help quickly label them.
In an email to VentureBeat, Nvidia said, “It doesn’t yet work remotely; it’s currently for in-person. But that would be an easy setup to make it a remote system. You might think of it as a system, or IP, to license for devices like the Furbo. The researchers see many possible applications but haven’t committed to anything yet.”
To refine the model, the researchers applied features of dogs from ImageNet to enable transfer learning. Next, they applied post-training and optimization techniques to boost speed and reduce model size.
For optimizations, they tapped into Nvidia’s Jetpack software development kit on Jetson, which is a lightweight AI platform for drones and other systems. It offers an easy way to get things up and running quickly and to access the TensorRT and cuDNN libraries, Stock said. Nvidia TensorRT optimization libraries offered “significant improvements in speed,” he added.
Tapping into the university’s computing system, Stock trained the model overnight on two 24GB Nvidia RTX 6000 graphics processing units (GPUs).
Deployed models on Henry
The researchers tested their models on Henry, Cavey’s Australian Shepherd. The model achieved accuracy of up to 92% in tests and demonstrated an ability to make split-second inference at nearly 40 frames per second.
Using the Jetson Nano, the system makes real-time decisions about dog behaviors and reinforces positive actions with a treat, transmitting a signal to release a reward.
“We looked at Raspberry Pi and Coral, but neither was adequate, and the choice was obvious for us to use Jetson Nano,” Cavey said.
Explainable AI helps provide transparency about the makeup of neural networks. It’s becoming more common in the financial services industry as a way to understand fintech models. Stock and Cavey included model interpretation in their paper to provide explainable AI for the pet industry.
They do this with images of the videos that show the posture analysis. One set of images relies on GradCAM — a common technique for displaying where a convolutional neural network model is focused. Another set of images explains the model by tapping into Integrated Gradients, which helps analyze pixels.
The researchers said it was important to create a trustworthy and ethical component of the AI system for trainers and general users. Otherwise, there’s no way to explain the methodology, should it come into question.
“We can explain what our model is doing, and that might be helpful to certain stakeholders — otherwise how can you back up what your model is really learning?” Cavey said.VentureBeat

Somewhere in an apartment complex in Hyderabad, a 30-something woman has just started her day. With chores lining up and errands to run, she finds herself at a loss for time for herself. But the lifesize interactive fitness screen in the hallway is a quick remedy to this. Designed with artificial intelligence, the ‘mirror’ is a mini gym with on-demand personalised fitness classes, and exercises that are focused on cardio, yoga and even boxing. This customised compact fitness model is a product of startup Portl, founded by friends Vishal Chandapeta, Armaan Khandari and Indraneel Gupta. The trio hailing from Hyderabad come from a background of technology and have each contributed their varying expertise to this unique fitness startup. The aim, they say, is to make every home in India equipped with the AI-powered 3D screen to improve holistic health. ‘We wanted to make fitness accessible.’How often do you skip going to the gym because it’s too far; or skip a workout because you don’t know the correct way of doing it? As Indraneel and Vishal noted, these were common concerns that people looking to start their fitness journey faced. At the time, they were engaged in a startup that built applications for other players in the fitness and wellness space.     This gave them a vantage point to launch Portl. The initial idea was to create a smart device that would have everything a person needed to workout, provide users with guidance on wellness and lifestyle all in the comfort of their home. With the closing down of their previous venture during the peak of the pandemic, and with this innovative idea all ready to take flight, the duo decided there was no better time to start than now.  The AI powered smart mirror enables users to access personalised workouts and fitness plans, Picture source: Instagram: Portl“A lot of our customers were from the fitness industry globally, and so we had an understanding of what people were looking for. Especially with the advent of the pandemic, an increasing number of people were starting to work out from home and were looking for professional trainers to help them. Everything aligned,” says Indraneel.    This unique idea eventually led to the launch of Portl in 2021 in Hyderabad. The duo were joined by Armaan, a close school friend of Indraneel. How does the AI mirror work?  View this post on InstagramA post shared by ＰＯＲＴＬ (@portlfitness)  When the trio first started out, they wanted to personalise fitness according to an individual’s needs. “Though there were virtual fitness apps, the issue with them was a lack of good professional trainers. This essentially meant that people were performing exercises without knowing if it was actually beneficial for their body type or not,” says Indraneel, pointing out that no human contact also meant that exercises and workouts were not tailor-made keeping in mind the injuries the person had. “People would often end up not seeing results and giving up the workout midway,” he says.  This compelled the trio to attempt to design a device and software that would ensure every user got a highly regulated programme that kept their current health conditions in mind, while also conducting health baseline tests. The AI mirror makes it possible for people to access professional trainers and have a customised workout, in contrast to a one-size-fits-all regime. Due to the integration of AI, as well as the health information that people input, suitable workouts will be available that will not aggravate the user’s preexisting conditions, if any. Through the months that followed, the trio put their heads together brainstorming on the software and applications that they wanted the smart device to possess. But a major challenge was figuring out how to integrate the hardware with the software.    However, they say the combined expertise they brought to the table helped significantly. “We each had significant experience in the fitness domain, and we formed a team that comprised top fitness experts. The knowledge was ready. All we had to do was integrate it into the system,” explains Indraneel, adding that within a year, they were ready with a prototype. The Portl mirror is a classy addition to the living room, occupying 2.5 ft of floor space and is equipped with biosensors. These provide feedback on the user’s strength and stability, giving the trainer a sense of their physical capacity and limitations. “It helps us determine the starting point of the individual’s journey,” explains Indraneel, adding that this is a crucial element. “When people workout unsupervised and at a random starting point, they rely on their own ability to execute the workout correctly, often injuring themselves in the process.”To avoid this, the smart mirror comes equipped with a feedback feature, wherein the sensors detect the person’s posture, angles of bending, etc and relay to them the correct way of doing the workout. The Portl studio is a comprehensive one, equipped with a pocket-sized bio sense device that can track your ECG, Blood sugar, temperature, blood pressure, and more. There is also a Buddy Workout feature on the platform that lets users workout in groups or do yoga as a family. Another sensor provides information to the user on their technique, just like a personal trainer would. “To add to this, there are live classes and also 1:1 interactions wherein users can interact with their coaches, talk about workouts, nutrition, and share experiences with other members of the platform. This creates the feeling of community,” says Vishal. He adds that in time they plan on launching a feature which would enable the trainer to appear in the mirror during the workout. In January this year, Portal scaled heights when they took this innovation to the sets of Shark Tank India Season 2, where they won Rs 1.5 crore  for 2.5 per cent equity. ‘It gave us a national viewing audience.’Portl vowed the judges on Shark Tank India Season 2 with their innovation, Picture source: Instagram: PortlCurrently, the startup is busy manufacturing the smart device to fulfil the 1000-plus orders they have received, a majority of which they say is because of the visibility they got with Shark Tank. Recounting the experience, Indraneel terms it ‘exciting’ for many reasons. “Along with enabling us to showcase the product to the ‘sharks’ we also got a national viewing audience. It helped us establish a sense of trust as we could demonstrate the idea behind starting the company.”Today, Portal has a network of 20 world-class trainers and professionals who the team say fitness enthusiasts would find it tough to get access to otherwise. The platform boasts of 15 different workout formats and even pain management for elderly people along with bodybuilding, karate, etc. Not just in India but even abroad the startup has managed to make waves, shipping to the US, Canada, Middle East, Singapore and the UK. Sounds Interesting?

Deep learning AI discovers surprising new antibiotics

Sriram Chandrasekaran, University of Michigan

(THE CONVERSATION) Imagine you’re a fossil hunter. You spend months in the heat of Arizona digging up bones only to find that what you’ve uncovered is from a previously discovered dinosaur.

That’s how the search for antibiotics has panned out recently. The relatively few antibiotic hunters out there keep finding the same types of antibiotics.

With the rapid rise in drug resistance in many pathogens, new antibiotics are desperately needed. It may be only a matter of time before a wound or scratch becomes life-threatening. Yet few new antibiotics have entered the market of late, and even these are just minor variants of old antibiotics.

 
While the prospects look bleak, the recent revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) offers new hope. In a study published on Feb. 20 in the journal Cell, scientists from MIT and Harvard used a type of AI called deep learning to discover new antibiotics.

The traditional way of discovering antibiotics – from soil or plant extracts – has not revealed new candidates, and there are many social and economic hurdles to solving this problem, as well. Some scientists have recently tried to tackle it by searching the DNA of bacteria for new antibiotic-producing genes. Others are looking for antibiotics in exotic locations such as in our noses.

Drugs found through such unconventional methods face a rocky road to reach the market. The drugs that are effective in a petri dish may not work well inside the body. They may not be absorbed well or may have side effects. Manufacturing these drugs in large quantities is also a significant challenge.
Deep learning

Enter deep learning. These algorithms power many of today’s facial recognition systems and self-driving cars. They mimic how neurons in our brains operate by learning patterns in data. An individual artificial neuron – like a mini sensor – might detect simple patterns like lines or circles. By using thousands of these artificial neurons, deep learning AI can perform extremely complex tasks like recognizing cats in videos or detecting tumors in biopsy images.

Given its power and success, it might not be surprising to learn that researchers hunting for new drugs are embracing deep learning AI. Yet building an AI method for discovering new drugs is no trivial task. In large part, this is because in the field of AI there’s no free lunch.

 
The No Free Lunch theorem states that there is no universally superior algorithm. This means that if an algorithm performs spectacularly in one task, say facial recognition, then it will fail spectacularly in a different task, like drug discovery. Hence researchers can’t simply use off-the-shelf deep learning AI.

The Harvard-MIT team used a new type of deep learning AI called graph neural networks for drug discovery. Back in the AI stone age of 2010, AI models for drug discovery were built using text descriptions of chemicals. This is like describing a person’s face through words such as “dark eyes” and “long nose.” These text descriptors are useful but obviously don’t paint the entire picture. The AI method used by the Harvard-MIT team describes chemicals as a network of atoms, which gives the algorithm a more complete picture of the chemical than text descriptions can provide.

Human knowledge and AI blank slates

Yet deep learning alone is not sufficient to discover new antibiotics. It needs to be coupled with deep biological knowledge of infections.

The Harvard-MIT team meticulously trained the AI algorithm with examples of drugs that are effective and those that aren’t. In addition, they used drugs that are known to be safe in humans to train the AI. They then used the AI algorithm to identify potentially safe yet potent antibiotics from millions of chemicals.

Unlike people, AI has no preconceived notions, especially about what an antibiotic should look like. Using old-school AI, my lab recently discovered some surprising candidates for treating tuberculosis, including an anti-psychotic drug. In the study by the Harvard-MIT team, they found a gold mine of new candidates. These candidate drugs do not look anything like existing antibiotics. One promising candidate is Halicin, a drug being explored for treating diabetes.

Halicin, surprisingly, was potent not only against E. coli, the bacteria the AI algorithm was trained on, but also on more deadly pathogens, including those that cause tuberculosis and colon inflammation. Notably, Halicin was potent against drug resistant Acinetobacter baumanni. This bacterium tops the list of most deadly pathogens compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Unfortunately, Halicin’s broad potency suggests that it may also destroy harmless bacteria in our body. It may also have metabolic side effects, since it was originally designed as an anti-diabetic drug. Given the dire need for new antibiotics, these may be small sacrifices to pay to save lives.

Keeping ahead of evolution

Given the promise of Halicin, should we stop the search for new antibiotics?

Halicin might clear all hurdles and eventually reach the market. But it still needs to overcome an unrelenting foe that’s the main cause of the drug resistance crisis: evolution. Humans have thrown numerous drugs at pathogens over the past century. Yet pathogens have always evolved resistance. So it likely wouldn’t be long until we encounter a Halicin-resistant infection. Nevertheless, with the power of deep learning AI, we may now be better suited to quickly respond with a new antibiotic.

Many challenges lie ahead for potential antibiotics discovered using AI to reach the clinic. The conditions in which these drugs are tested are different from those inside the human body. New AI tools are being built by my lab and others to simulate the body’s internal environment to assess antibiotic potency. AI models can also now predict drug toxicity and side effects. These AI technologies together may soon give us a leg up in the never-ending battle against drug resistance.

Bloomberg 


The inventor of several key technologies used by Amazon.com’s Alexa service raised $20 million to fund a new startup in the U.K.William Tunstall-Pedoe said his Cambridge- and London-based company, Unlikely AI, needed the money to start hiring developers of a new type of artificial intelligence software. “Everyone is locked onto a path of machine learning with big neural networks,” Tunstall-Pedoe said in an interview. “It is very unclear that this path will lead to a generally intelligent machine. We are taking a contrarian fresh look at doing this.” Amadeus Capital Partners, Octopus Ventures, and Patrick Pichette, the former chief financial officer of Google and current Twitter board member, are among the backers of the startup.

Amazon’s Echo devices incorporate technology Tunstall-Pedoe helped develop at Evi, a British startup the world’s biggest retailer acquired in 2012. At the time, Evi’s voice-activated search app was among the strongest competitors to Apple’s infant Siri.

The first Alexa-powered Echo speaker was a runaway success for Amazon; Meta, Apple, Google, and other companies all released rival products to the cylindrical device. Although selling millions of Echo speakers and employing 10,000 people to work on Alexa in the years since, Amazon has struggled to keep customers engaged, Bloomberg has previously reported. Tunstall-Pedoe left Amazon in 2016 and became one of a group of U.K.-based early-stage investors, advising AI companies such as Ada Health and Fluent.ai.“I always knew I had one or two Evi-sized startups left in me,” he said. “I’ve been thinking about it since I left Amazon.”Unlikely AI launched its first product during the COVID-19 pandemic — an app that solves and explains cryptic crossword clues. Long before Alexa’s creation, Tunstall-Pedoe built an anagram algorithm used by author Dan Brown for books such as his 2003 bestseller “The Da Vinci Code.”

 Since its discrete release in late November, ChatGPT has become one of the fastest growing apps ever and pushed Microsoft and Google to rush out projects that had until now stayed carefully guarded over fears that the technology wasn't yet ready for the public.

ChatGPT, Silicon Valley's latest app sensation, has investors rushing to find the next big thing in generative AI, the technology that some hail as the beginning of a new era in big tech.
Artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly present in everyday life for decades, but the November launch of the conversational robot from start-up OpenAI marked a turning point in its perception by the general public and investors.
""Every so often we have platforms that come along and result in an explosion of new companies. We saw this with the internet and mobile, and AI could be the next platform."" said Shernaz Daver of California-based Khosla Ventures.
Generative AI, of which ChatGPT is an example, wades through oceans of data to conjure up original content - an image, a poem, a thousand-word essay - in seconds and upon a simple request.
Since its discrete release in late November, ChatGPT has become one of the fastest growing apps ever and pushed Microsoft and Google to rush out projects that had until now stayed carefully guarded over fears that the technology wasn't yet ready for the public.


""Just five days after its release, a million people used ChatGPT - about 60 times faster than it took Facebook to reach one million users,"" said Wayne Hu, a partner at SignalFire, another venture capital firm..

""Suddenly investors are all talking about how ChatGPT might eliminate millions of knowledge worker jobs, disrupt trillion-dollar industries, and fundamentally change the way we learn, consume, and make decisions,"" he said.
The explosion of generative AI comes at an otherwise morose time for the tech sector, with tens of thousands of layoffs cascading through the world's biggest companies as well as smaller ones that are struggling for survival.
""While other categories are facing a contraction in valuations and raising capital, generative AI companies are not,"" said Daver.
Hu said that the market valuations for generative AI companies have been sky high, while they have contracted for everything else.

- 'Hard to keep up' -
OpenAI, the ChatGPT creator, is valued by Microsoft at nearly $30 billion despite still burning through money at a high speed, he said.
Entrepreneurs specializing in generative AI say they no longer need to scream out for attention when hunting for cash or walk through the details of what they are trying to offer.
""It's helped us a lot,"" said Sarah Nagy, founder of Seek AI, a start-up that allows nonspecialists to extract technical data from a database using queries in everyday language.
""Before ChatGPT... I had to explain what generative AI is, and why it matters,"" she added.
Now the appetite for ChatGPT-like capabilities is seemingly limitless, and not only from investors.
""The demand from customers has increased a lot,"" said Nagy. ""It's even hard to keep up, because we're still a small company.""
The entrepreneur wants to grow her team and, according to Daver, while the trend is to downsize, ""we are currently hiring"" in generative AI.
In the last few weeks, it is mainly the giants that have been in the news, first and foremost Microsoft, OpenAI's partner and investor, followed by Google, which is trying to keep up.
But in their shadow, a galaxy of start-ups have ideas on offer too.

Other recent examples of funding rounds include California-based Kognitos, which aims to automate administrative tasks, and the platform for designers Poly that can whip out 3D graphics or maps in seconds.
In addition to the usual venture capitalists, tech giants are on the lookout, like Google, which just invested $300 million to acquire 10 percent of newcomer Anthropic and its chatbot Claude.
Hu said the ChatGPT ""gold rush"" could be unprecedented and expand well beyond Generative AI because the very technology itself minimizes the need for a computer coder or designer to execute ideas.
""Now you no longer need to get a Stanford PhD in computer science: any developer can build something amazing on top of ChatGPT and other foundation models in one weekend.""
""This wave of AI could be bigger than mobile or the cloud, and more on the scale of something like the Industrial Revolution that changed the course of human history,"" Hu said.

CBSE Chairperson Manoj Ahuja stated that with the help of IBM, they were proud to lead the way for the nation by developing an innovative training-based learning approach for students and teachers. This course was first launched by IMB and CBSE back in September of 2019. Meanwhile, the CBSE results for class 10 were released online on July 15, 2020.
However, the result declaration had its own problems and glitches. According to several students, their mark sheet erroneously claims that they were born in the year 2020. This date error seems to be a technical glitch and the CBSE board may recall all mark sheets to correct the error.

The researchers shared a short video on the institution's Weibo account on June 30th, 2022, demonstrating what they called ""artificial intelligence empowering party-building."" The video has since been deleted; however, the Internet Archive was able to store a text summary of the video. The video was removed due to the controversial, political nature of the creation and backlash invoking references to George Orwell's 1984.According to Anhui-based sociologist Song Da'an, the AI was trained using a combination of polygraphs and facial scans, so it could correlate lies detected by a polygraph with various facial expressions. The result is ""emotionally intelligent computing,"" that measures how much people ""feel grateful to the CCP [Chinese Communist Party[, do as it tells them and follow its lead.""""This equipment is a kind of smart ideology, using AI technology to extract and integrate facial expressions, EEG readings and skin conductivity ... making it possible to ascertain the levels of concentration, recognition and mastery of ideological and political education so as to better understand its effectiveness. It can provide real data for organizers of ideological and political education, so they can keep improving their methods of education and enrich content,"" the original video's description read.""Hefei Comprehensive National Science Center has been using biotechnology to measure the loyalty of party members and cadres. This shows that the CCP is becoming more and more totalitarian ...They are using this technology to treat all party members as potential anti-CCP agents. The use of these technology on officials demonstrates the sorry state of affairs within party ranks,"" said Da'an.Read more about this story in this article from Radio Free Asia (RFA).China: The NovelTodayYesterday7 days ago30 days ago$12.99---Buy* Prices last scanned on 7/7/2022 at 8:53 am CDT - prices may not be accurate, click links above for the latest price.

Dispelling three popular myths about AI

Are these misconceptions holding back your organization’s AI strategy?

 Shares

The many benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) can no longer be denied which is why more organizations are now turning to this emerging technology to remain nimble in the face of change. However, implementing an AI strategy without knowing what you want to achieve can not only be costly but ultimately sets a business up for failure.To learn more about some common misconceptions that may be holding organizations back from yielding the full potential value of their investments in AI, TechRadar Pro spoke with global consulting data and analytics leader at EY, Beatriz Sanz Saiz.We've put together a list of the best cloud computing servicesThese are the best AI platforms for businessAlso check out our roundup of the best workstationsCan you tell us about your background and when you first became interested in artificial intelligence?I am a mathematician as a background, and I’ve been a partner at EY for the last 15 years. I’m currently leading data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) for consulting globally. In my role, I lead more than 9,000 professionals driving the strategy to infuse analytics and AI into our work. Our clients come to us to help them solve their toughest challenges, to establish analytics and innovation, and help them navigate the hurdles, opportunities and ethics behind AI and other emerging technologies.
My interest in AI peaked when I began to realize there is a unique opportunity to challenge the status quo by harvesting analytics and AI to reinvent the traditional approach to problem solving. My ambition is to open the eyes of organizations by helping them understand that greater adoption in AI in turn leads to new mindsets and encourages a transformation culture that can truly benefit their core business.What are the biggest hurdles holding organizations back from adopting AI today?Looking at the findings of our recent EY Tech Horizon survey, businesses told us that the biggest barriers to embracing emerging technologies, such as AI, are lack of transformation culture (32%), legacy technology (32%), lack of collaboration across departments (30%) and lack of skills internally to compete in the digital economy (27%). Looking at the health sector in particular, lack of skills seemed to be an issue, with 78% of health companies agreeing that skills shortage is a major problem.(Image credit: Shutterstock)How can AI help businesses drive growth and when can they expect to see a return on their investment?Businesses that want to transform to remain competitive need to embrace technologies such as AI, while leveraging three critical value drivers: placing humans at the center of their organization, leveraging technology at speed and enabling innovation at scale.
There are many long-term benefits to enabling and accelerating an AI strategy, such as radical customer centricity, agility, insights and prediction, efficiency, and growth. The best approach to get started consists of businesses asking themselves some key questions, such as “Will we still be relevant in two, five- or ten-years’ time?,” and “What kind of growth do we want to achieve?”. Then, by working through future-back scenarios and thinking strategically around how they incorporate AI, businesses can then work out what they need to modify to ensure they’re following a path to maintain relevance today, and 15 years from now.Why do some companies still believe AI should be kept away from their core operations and data?There is still a lack of understanding of the potential of AI, how it works and what it requires in terms of data infrastructure, trust and change management. If companies believe that AI comes with security risks, they may apply AI in a separate business unit, rather than implementing it in the heart of the operations. However, our survey found that 45% of organizations will invest in scaling AI in the next two years. Actually, this is the future. Using AI to run core processes to learn by the second, learn with every single transaction or customer interaction. This is the way to gain competitiveness and efficiency.
By building the AI strategy into their legacy applications and infrastructure, businesses can start to see the value gains far quicker. In order to gain better control over the risks implicated with AI, leaders should look to offer incentives to their IT staff to encourage them to future proof the workforce against potential security attacks and deploy robust training programs in AI competencies to help build skills for staff in-house.(Image credit: Shutterstock)How do AI and IoT overlap and what are the advantages of using these two emerging technologies together?AI and IoT technologies are maturing exponentially and it is clear in our survey that the two technologies correlate. Over half (54%) of AI-focused companies also invested in IoT in the last two years, compared to 50% of overall corporates. Albeit a very slight uplift, this indicates that businesses willing to invest in AI are also aware of the benefits to implementing IoT, and these investments are effective, with 48% of AI-focused companies stating that IoT is having a very positive impact on their ability to innovate.
To get the most value out of these technologies, they should be used in tandem. IoT can help businesses collect data for every sensor enabling AI better measure processes, people’s behavior or an asset’s condition. Then, when this data is sent to the cloud, AI will enforce the correct algorithms and methods to process this information. For example, if you look at an autonomous vehicle, IoT collects the necessary data such as location, speed and proximity to objects, while AI will then translate this data into tangible actions, telling the car to slow down, turn a corner or stop.
Starbucks is also combining the technologies to great effect. The coffee giant has invested in connected espresso machines that can alert the company when they need tuning or maintaining, reducing downtime and improving the customer experience.
Companies embracing these crossovers are gaining expertise in the capabilities when AI and IoT are used simultaneously, allowing them to replicate techniques and gain value in other areas of their business. By examining which parts of the business are benefiting most and building proof-of-concepts, leaders can explore new solutions that deliver to their customers' needs.What steps can organizations take to ensure that they’re using trusted data from a reliable source?Data can be sourced from anywhere, such as business tools and applications, website analytics, industrial equipment, wearables, social media – its sources are limitless. However, to build a trusted AI system, data must be compliant, accurate, clean, and most importantly, relevant for the intended purpose. Data has to have meaning. It’s the most important thing to build trusted data and build AI at scale. Unreliable data can derive from poor data-collection practices such as customer relationship management (CRM) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) or from call centers, to name a few. Businesses that use practices such as these aren’t necessarily aiming for qualitative data.
To overcome this challenge, it's imperative that companies build a “business data fabric” and execute a strong data governance, as an integral part of the fabric, to help them monitor the data they use to train AI models. However, our research shows that only 8% of corporate companies have a governance function already established, so this is an area on which businesses need to be advised.
Consequently, AI itself can also be part of the solution to fix data quality, with algorithms being able to extract information from handwritten forms, amend data entry errors and match information across systems. AI can be used to self-discover data, enabling an automated matching between technical terms and business terms, so that data can be meaningful and trusted. Companies will still need human validation checks, but machine learning will “learn” from these human interventions with the system becoming smarter and smarter over time. In this way, businesses can ensure AI applications leverage only trusted data.
In fact, our Trusted AI Platform provides insights to organizations on the sources and drivers of risk and guides an AI design team in quantifying AI risks. By developing a quantitative score of an AI system’s residual risk, the EY Trusted AI Platform calculates the residual risk of an AI system. Based on the anticipated impact on users, stakeholder risk acts as a multiplier to technical risk, considering social and ethical implications. The evaluation of governance and control maturity acts as a mitigating factor to reduce residual risk of an AI system.What advice would you give to a company trying to implement an AI strategy for the first time?Firstly, businesses who are unskilled in this area should take their lead from organizations who said in our survey that they are implementing new incentives to encourage their workforce to upskill (58%) as well as enforcing mandatory training programs (57%). By taking this approach, they can begin by training the right employees before getting started.
Secondly, as previously mentioned, understanding the overall goal of what you want AI to achieve to take your business to the next level, then working out what that strategy looks like is the next obvious step. Once this has been initiated, companies must start walking the talk, identifying the right use cases and measures of success. Then they can progressively rethink their tech and data frameworks, data fabric and modernize their legacy technology infrastructure accordingly.How do you think AI will evolve in the next five years and will the technology become as ubiquitous as cloud computing is today?Just as the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the pace of change towards digital transformation, AI adoption will clearly speed up. AI will consolidate as the technology that will sit are the critical paths of any process of an Enterprise, whether is customer facing or back office operations.
AI will drive significant changes in the majority of industries’ value chains, and we are starting to see that now: look at health and biotech, retail, manufacturing and the public sector. These are just a few examples. It’s actually hard to think of an industry that will not be impacted. Even sports such as international automobile racing and other competitive sports are now driven by end-to-end data analysis.We've also highlighted the best business laptops

The Hamden Journal Podcast: LensaAI selfies and ChatGPT dominated our socials this week 
December 9, 2022 by Joe Brock 

This week, many of us saw our social media feeds taken over by colorful, surreal pictures of people we follow, except they don’t quite look like themselves. The images were generated by Lensa AI, and it’s the latest in what feels like a now-annual trend to use a new app to create mockups of your face in various scenarios. Alongside Lensa, some folks also saw blocks of text from another AI generator, ChatGPT. So on this episode of the podcast, Devindra and Cherlynn chat the appeal, implications and possible future of these types of AI, before being joined by The Hamden Journal editor-at-large James Trew for a check in on the state of action cameras.

 GENEVA (AP) — The voices sound like well-known personalities, the music features trendy dance beats and hip-hop syncopations, and the jokes and laughter are contagious. But listeners of an offbeat Swiss public radio station repeatedly got the message on Thursday: Today's programming is brought to you by Artificial Intelligence.

Three months in the making, the French-language station Couleur 3 (Color 3) is touting a one-day experiment using cloned voices of five real, human presenters — in what managers claim is a world first — and never-aired-before music composed almost entirely by computers, not people. From 6 a.m. to 7 p.m., the station said, AI controlled its airwaves. Every 20 minutes, listeners got a reminder.
 With an eerie, Sci-Fi movie-like track whirring in the background, a soothing, raspy female voice said: “AI is taking your favorite radio by storm.”
“For 13 hours, our digital alter egos have taken the reins, broadcasting their voices and their messages across the airwaves, without mercy or respite,” the voice said, at times almost taunting listeners. “The boundaries between human and machine have been blurred, and it’s up to you to unravel what's real and what's fake.""
""Our voice clones and AI are here to unsettle, surprise and shake you. And for that matter, this text was also written by a robot.”
The explosive emergence of ChatGPT last autumn and other ""Generative AI"" tools have caused a stir — and often fear, confusion, fascination, laughter, or worry — about the long-term economic, cultural, social and even political consequences. Some musicians have complained that AI has ripped off their styles.
In the face of such recalcitrance, the Swiss station, which falls under the umbrella of public broadcaster Radio Television Switzerland, notes the concerns about AI — and embraces and seeks to de-mystify it.

Antoine Multone, the station’s chief, said Couleur 3 could get away with the experiment because it’s already known as “provocative.”
While some might fear the project could be a first step toward the obsolescence of people on the air — and firings of personnel too — or could weaken journalism, he defended the project as a lesson on how to live with AI.
“I think if we become ostriches ... we put our heads in the sand and say, ‘Mon Dieu, there’s a new technology! We’re all going to die!’ then yeah, we’re going to die because it (AI) is coming, whether we like it or not,” Multone said by phone. “We want to master the technology so we can then put limits on it.”
Some have gone even further, like Seven Hills, Ohio-based media company Futuri, which has rolled out RadioGPT that relies on AI.
At Couleur 3, the voices of the presenters were cloned with the help of software company Respeecher, which has worked with Hollywood studios and whose website says its team is mostly based in Ukraine.
Station managers say it took three months to train the AI to understand the needs of the station and adopt its quirky, offbeat vibe. The tracks aired during the day were at least partially composed by AI and some were entirely, “and that's also a first,"" Multone said. AI was behind the voices that sang songs broadcast in the morning, and it played DJ in the afternoon — selecting copyrighted music.
To avoid any possible confusion with today's real news, the synthetic voices — indistinguishable from a real person's — served up top-of-the-hour news flashes that were way too futuristic to be believable: A temporary ban on spaceship flights over Geneva airspace due to noise complaints; the opening of the first underwater restaurant in Lake Zurich; extraterrestrial tourists who mistook swans on Swiss lake for inflatable toys.

 
The AI had been instructed to come up with news that might be read in the year 2070.
Multone acknowledged a lot of discussion among staffers about whether to go through with it, and “I was ready to pull the plug on the project if I had seen that my team wasn't 100% motivated to try it.”
Hundreds of messages poured into the station in the morning shortly after the programming began, Swiss public radio said in a statement. One complained of boring jokes. Another listener, stupefied, admitted to being stumped. One critic called the project a waste of time for a station that gets public funding.
“The main feedback we get, in 90% of the messages, is: ‘It's cool, but there's a human element missing. You can sense these are robots, and there are fewer surprises, less personality,'"" Multone said, noting an on-air discussion of the experiment was planned Friday — by real people.
“Many messages just said: ‘Give us back our humans!’"" he said. ""I think that's great.”

The tech giant on Monday described its new agreement as the third stage of a growing partnership with San Francisco-based OpenAI that began with a $1 billion investment in 2019. It didn’t disclose the dollar amount for its latest investment. 
OpenAI’s free writing tool ChatGPT launched on Nov. 30 and has brought public attention to the possibilities of new advances in AI. 
It’s part of a new generation of AI systems that can converse, generate readable text on demand and even produce novel images and video based on what they’ve learned from a vast database of digital books, online writings and other media.


        Insight by Coupa: In this exclusive webinar edition of Ask the CIO, learn about how one of the most well-known agencies partners innovation and procurement to meet its mission. 

OpenAI started out as a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company when it launched in December 2015. With Tesla CEO Elon Musk as its co-chair and among its early investors, the organization’s stated aims were to “advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return.”
That changed in 2018 when it incorporated a for-profit business Open AI LP, and shifted nearly all its staff into the business, not long after releasing its first generation of the GPT model for generating human-like paragraphs of readable text. Musk also left its board in 2018.
OpenAI is also the creator of the DALL-E tool for generating new images.
Microsoft said Monday its strengthened partnership can help “to accelerate AI breakthroughs to ensure these benefits are broadly shared with the world.”

The aim is for the Reaper to be able to carry out autonomous flight, decide where to direct its battery of sensors, and to recognize objects on the ground. The contract, announced at the end of last month, builds on a successful test earlier this year.
In some ways this is not a major development, more of an incremental step using existing technology. What makes it significant is the drone that is being equipped, and what it will be able to do afterwards. 

The MQ-9 Reaper is the mainstay of the U.S. drone force, equipped with advanced sensors and a ... [+] variety of precision weapons.

GA-ASI


Military drones are notoriously backward when it comes to on-board intelligence, even compared to their tiny cousins in the consumer world. You can buy a drone like the SkyDio 2 which can carry out a complete flight on its own, taking off and locking on to the owner to autonomously shoot video of them while they surf, ski or skateboard, then landing automatically afterwards. By contrast, military drones need a remote pilot to take off and land, and a payload operator to point the cameras and other sensors at the target (not to mention launching missiles).

The biggest drone manpower requirement is PED — processing, exploitation and dissemination – the teams of analysts who look through hours and hours of high-resolution video, trying to determine whether people on the ground are mending a pothole or planting an IED, whether someone is carrying a mortar tube, an RPG  or just a length of pipe, and similar challenges. This is something AI, especially machine learning, might help with.

In September, the Air Force announced that General Atomics had flown a Reaper fitted with a new device known as an Agile Condor pod under its wing for the first time.

An Air Force Research laboratory presentation shows how Agile Condor will enable the drone to fly ... [+] missions without human input.

U.S. Air Force


Agile Condor, which has been in development by the Air Force Research Laboratory for some years, is effectively a flying supercomputer – ‘high-performance embedded computing ‘ — optimized for artificial intelligence applications. Built by SRC Inc, it packs the maximum computing capacity into the minimum space, with the lowest possible power requirements. Its modular architecture is built around machine learning (suggesting a lot of GPUs or other processors optimized for parallel processing) and the makers anticipate upgrades to neuromorphic computing hardware which mimics the human brain. 
One of the key aims of Agile Condor is speeding up the PED process. At the mass of data is beams back to an operations center , as far as the bandwidth allows, and then pored over to extract information. Agile Condor’s AI should be able to do all that instantly without needing to send the data anywhere.
“Instead of taking hours, sometimes days or even weeks – decisions can now be made in near real-time. If the system detects an anomaly on the ground, warfighters are alerted within minutes, allowing them to investigate and act while it’s still relevant,” according to SRC’s page on Agile Condor.
It also opens up the possibility of the Reaper operating on its own. An Air Force slide of the Agile Condor concept of operations shows the drone losing both its communications link and GPS navigation at the start of its mission. An existing Reaper would circle in place or fly back to try and re-establish communications; the AI-boosted version uses its AI to navigate using landmarks and find the target area – as well as spotting threats on the ground and changing its flight path to avoid them. 
The Agile Condor was evidently a success, and the new contract suggests that the Air Force wants more of this.
“This will bring a tremendous increase in unmanned systems capabilities for applications across the full-range of military operations,” said GA-ASI Vice President of Strategic Development J.R. Reid in a press release.
Of course when most people think about Reaper operations they think about drone strikes on terrorists and insurgents. When it comes to autonomous weapons, the Pentagon’s stated policy is always that a human operator will always make the firing decision, this policy has some flexibility: it simply demands “appropriate levels of human judgment,” whatever that means. 
Nobody is suggesting that the AI-equipped Reapers will be carrying out autonomous strike missions if communication is impossible; but this might become a tempting possibility as the technology evolves. And, as Forbes has previously noted, the U.S. has changed it stance on Reaper exports, leading to a slew of recent deals including with the UAE and even Morocco. If an AI upgrade is available, there are likely to be plenty of takers. The capability would certainly keep the Reaper ahead of the growing competition from Chinese, Turkish and Israeli drone makers, but the U.S. might have little say in how it was used.

(""Hayden AI""), a leading provider of smart traffic enforcement solutions powered by artificial intelligence, has been awarded a patent for technology that automatically manages and analyzes traffic rules for violation enforcement and enables data-informed operational improvements for government agencies. The patent was awarded on May 3, 2022 and is labeled U.S. Patent number 11,322,017 B1.PATENT IMAGE(PRNewswire)Hayden AI awarded patent for technology that automatically manages and analyzes traffic rules for violation enforcementThe new patented technology facilitates the management of complex traffic rules using a traffic enforcement layer situated on top of a semantic map layer. The map layer, which consists of street elements such as intersections and stop signs, is continuously updated with data captured by Hayden AI edge devices already installed on municipal vehicles for automated enforcement. The enforcement layer consists of traffic rules that can be adjusted directly by the user or automatically via a traffic insight layer, which is generated based on traffic violations and traffic conditions. By analyzing the impact of traffic rules, the insight layer also provides suggestions for adjustments.""We devised this method because defining and managing traffic rules digitally hasn't been done successfully before,"" said Bo Shen, CTO and Co-Founder of Hayden AI. ""Our pilot programs consistently show that using AI to manage traffic rules is significantly more efficient and flexible than the traditional logic-based approach. We've also built in mechanisms that enable municipalities to gauge the effectiveness of particular traffic rules or lane restrictions  in reducing traffic congestion as well as  keeping buses on schedule.""In addition to using artificial intelligence to automatically learn and manage traffic rules, the new system allows municipalities to directly update these rules via an interactive map editor. Government entities can also import raw traffic rule data from a transportation department database  and generate a heat map of traffic violations detected by edge devices to update the insight layer.By providing several methods to add and modify enforcement rules, the system helps government entities to update ineffective restrictions and ensure that enforcement results in a reduction in traffic congestion and crashes and an improvement in travel times and safety.About Hayden AI: Hayden AI is pioneering smart traffic enforcement with its mobile platform to increase the safety, efficiency, and sustainability of municipal fleet vehicles. Our platform allows government agencies to enforce traffic laws, while harnessing AIoT data to gain actionable insights that help enhance the quality of life of their communities. Developed by a team of experts in machine learning, data science, transportation, and government technology, our flagship product, Automated Bus Lane Enforcement, enforces dedicated bus lanes, delivery zones, and intersections to reduce traffic congestion, improve bus speeds, and increase transit ridership.To learn more about Hayden AI, visit www.hayden.aiView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hayden-ai-granted-patent-for-traffic-rule-management-technology-301576449.htmlSOURCE  Hayden AI Technologies, Inc.The above press release was provided courtesy of PRNewswire.

For more info and free online quotes, please visit https://compare-autoinsurance.Org/the-advantages-of-comparing-prices-with-car-insurance-quotes-online/ The modern society has numerous technological advantages. One important advantage is the speed at which information is sent and received. With the help of the internet, the shopping habits of many persons have drastically changed. The car insurance industry hasn't remained untouched by these changes. On the internet, drivers can compare insurance prices and find out which sellers have the best offers. View photos The advantages of comparing online car insurance quotes are the following: Online quotes can be obtained from anywhere and at any time. Unlike physical insurance agencies, websites don't have a specific schedule and they are available at any time. Drivers that have busy working schedules, can compare quotes from anywhere and at any time, even at midnight. Multiple choices. Almost all insurance providers, no matter if they are well-known brands or just local insurers, have an online presence. Online quotes will allow policyholders the chance to discover multiple insurance companies and check their prices. Drivers are no longer required to get quotes from just a few known insurance companies. Also, local and regional insurers can provide lower insurance rates for the same services. Accurate insurance estimates. Online quotes can only be accurate if the customers provide accurate and real info about their car models and driving history. Lying about past driving incidents can make the price estimates to be lower, but when dealing with an insurance company lying to them is useless. Usually, insurance companies will do research about a potential customer before granting him coverage. Online quotes can be sorted easily. Although drivers are recommended to not choose a policy just based on its price, drivers can easily sort quotes by insurance price. Using brokerage websites will allow drivers to get quotes from multiple insurers, thus making the comparison faster and easier.

LG CNS CEO Kim Young-shub (left) and Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education superintendent Cho Hee-yeon pose after a memorandum of understanding signing Monday. (LG CNS)LG CNS, an IT solution affiliate of LG Group, said Tuesday the company will provide artificial intelligence tutor services to support public English education at elementary through high schools in Seoul. The LG affiliate said it signed a memorandum of understanding with the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education on Monday to cooperate on an English teaching service dubbed “AI Tutor,” which will run based on the firm’s artificial intelligence program. The memorandum will support around 800,000 students from elementary to high schools to be able to study English both at home and school. The AI Tutor program will focus on improving speaking skills, providing the specialized platform Speaking Class for students. The company and education authority will work together to host English speaking contests as well. LG will be offering the AI Tutor and Speaking Class services for free, it said. AI Tutor is a commercialized service with 760,000 subscribers. With Carrot Global, YBM Net, Yoons English School and Pagoda as partners, it enables users to learn and practice hundreds of thousands of English sentences via smartphone. Including LG, employees of 150 companies are using the smartphone app. The Seoul Education Office plans to provide the LG platforms for around 1,300 elementary, middle and high schools in Seoul, and have teachers utilize the service for both regular and after-school classes. “The latest MOU will serve as an opportunity to introduce AI to public education,” said LG CNS CEO Kim Young-shub. “The company will contribute to public education with a belief that education is the cornerstone for any future.” By Song Su-hyun (song@heraldcorp.com)

Maltese AI Company Defining the Healthcare of Tomorrow In The UK
                    30th June 2020            
 
Reading Time:  3 minutesMaltese AI company EBO.ai has partnered with UK health informatics firm Servelec as Exclusive AI Partners for patient self-management and is now bringing innovative self-managed services to thousands of patients within the UK’s National Health Service (NHS). 
Through this collaboration, Servelec will integrate EBO.ai’s technology (now called the ‘Rio Virtual Assistant’) into its electronic patient record system to give NHS patients accessibility to set hospital appointments, reschedule or cancel them in real time, using their favourite messaging channel, instantly and 24/7.
The breakthrough technology was initially introduced to the East London NHS Foundation Trust and the Somerset NHS Foundation Trust which operate community hospitals and inpatient sites and engage almost 20,000 professionals and staff.
“The Rio Virtual Assistant fits perfectly into the NHS’s five-year plan to place data, information, and technology at the heart of its strategy to make the UK a global leader in the development and use of self-care solutions. Our partnership with UK’s Servelec is also particularly meaningful because it shows a major international player teaming up with a local company to serve the NHS in the UK better. Effectively this is an AI solution contributing to the transformation of UK healthcare,” says Dr. Gege Gatt, CEO of EBO.ai.
EBO.ai is a pioneer in creating platforms that automate the engagement between healthcare professionals and patients to solve the challenge of communication at scale. Servelec uses software to deliver better integrated care by providing solutions for interoperability across health, social care, education and youth services, connecting providers with citizens by enabling better communication between care providers.
“This development is also a meaningful step in EBO.ai’s journey to become an international company. Healthcare around the world is going through radical transformation as institutions move towards smart hospitals. This new breed of hospitals are built from the ground up on technologies that augment the patient experience while improving cost-efficiency and performance for health systems. We are proud that together with Servelec, we have been given the privilege to play an active role in defining the healthcare of tomorrow.”

“Our Virtual Assistant also allows caregivers to receive important patient insights so much so that we predict that our system can potentially reduce hospitals’ administrative costs by up to 80% in the patient administration function” added Dr. Gege Gatt.
Hospital administration costs are increasing at an exorbitantly high rate.
A 2018 article in the New York Times reports that in the US, just over 25% of total spending on hospital care goes to hospital administrative costs. Hospitals in the Netherlands registered the second-highest administrative costs at almost 20% of all hospital spending. In the UK, hospital administrative costs according to a 2014 survey already stood at 15.5% of what is now a £140 billion budget.
EBO.ai’s Rio Virtual Assistant not only provides a quality customer experience for patients, but also helps hospitals save time and money often spent on inefficient scheduling tasks. By allowing patients speedy and out of hours access to appointment re-scheduling, the solution reduces avoidable missed appointments thus addressing a major challenge in healthcare.
Missed appointments in England cost the NHS, £216 million every year. A quantitiative researche exercise compiled by YouGov.co.uk in 2019 demonstrated that 85% of patients who missed a hospital visit would have been motivated to attend if an automated reminder prompted them to do so. Using Artificial Intelligence to actually hold a dialogue with the patient would have made the experience more personal and effective.
“It’s a win-win situation. NHS staff get to access updated patient records wherever they are, patients enjoy an easy way to administer their hospital activity, hospitals have less administration work to cater for and Governments avoid budget seepage through ineffective practices” concluded Gege Gatt.

Check out all the on-demand sessions from the Intelligent Security Summit here.


Happy second full week of 2023. While our poor colleagues in California saw rain, more rain, and extended power outages, the news from CES in Las Vegas was hot, hot, hot.
But first, senior writer/editor Sharon Goldman broke the news that ChatGPT might be coming to Microsoft Office as soon as March this year. Will it be more helpful than the much-aligned Clippy? Stay tuned.
Our second and third top stories are wrap-ups from CES. In the first, our intrepid (and very tired) lead writer Dean Takahashi reviews the top 18 things he saw from the 3,000 exhibitors at the event. In the second CES story, Goldman highlights the AI and ML news from CES, and what it means for enterprises.
Our fourth story of the week is also from the AI beat. This one, though, is a little less optimistic, as it shows that AI companies aren’t immune to the effects of the current economic downturn.

Finally, our fifth story is from our security beat. Writer/editor Taryn Plumb interviewed security leaders from AWS to get their predictions for 2023. Spoiler alert: Zero trust might be mentioned.
Here are the top five stories for the week of January 9th. 
1. How ChatGPT in Microsoft Office could change the workplace | The AI Beat
Over the weekend, The Information reported that Microsoft is looking to add OpenAI’s chatbot technology — currently ChatGPT, soon to be GPT-4 — to its Office suite of productivity technologies, including Word, Outlook and PowerPoint. And late today, Semafor reported that Microsoft, which invested $1 billion in OpenAI in 2019, is in talks to invest another $10 billion in the company.
The stream of Microsoft news made me wonder: How would these apps-on-steroids, used by billions of companies globally, change how we work? Especially once Google gets fully in the game, integrating its own generative AI capabilities into Google Workspace? Will AI become as mundane in our day-to-day work lives as the humble spreadsheet?
2. The best products and moments of CES 2023 | The DeanBeat
The CES 2023 tech trade show was in full gear in Las Vegas last weekend, drawing lots of crowds back to the biggest North American tech trade fest.
At or ahead of CES 2023, I recorded around 80 press events, interviews, and sessions. I walked 87,447 steps over five days — or more than 38.81 miles. I wrote 43 stories. I gave two interviews. And moderated one panel. My feet hurt.
This year featured nearly 3,000 exhibitors, up from 1,900 in 2021 and down from 4,000 (in-person) in 2020. Here are the 18 things that caught my eye.
3. 5 AI takeaways from CES for enterprise business
Since CES is owned and produced by the Consumer Technology Association, it makes perfect sense that it is focused on consumer tech. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t significant enterprise business takeaways, particularly around artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).
That is particularly true in a year when few technologies are garnering as much hype as AI and ML — particularly when it comes to generative AI, including DALL-E and ChatGPT.
We asked for feedback from vendor experts about the most important AI and ML takeaways they saw coming out of CES 2023.
4. AI may be red-hot, but Scale AI layoffs send shivers           
In April 2021, data labeling service Scale AI had a $7 billion valuation and a CEO, Alexandr Wang, who was known in Silicon Valley as “the next Zuckerberg.”
But last night, Insider’s report that the unicorn company had laid off 20% of its 700-person staff sent shivers down the spines of those who thought AI was generally immune to the current wave of tech layoffs. Especially at this red-hot AI moment when Microsoft is reportedly in talks to invest $10 billion in OpenAI, and buzzy generative AI startups like Jasper and Stability AI are boasting about raises over $100 million.
5. AWS security heads offer top cybersecurity predictions for 2023
Last year (2022) was an unprecedented one for cybersecurity, in both good and bad ways. On the positive side, we saw increased use of passwordless and multifactor authentication (MFA) and zero-trust methods. On the negative, the cost of data breaches reached an all-time high and we saw the rise of commoditized cybercrime (ransomware-as-a-service) and massive breaches of Twitter, WhatsApp, Rockstar and Uber.
What might we see in 2023? VentureBeat posed this question to several AWS security leaders. Here are their top cybersecurity predictions for 2023.

No Comments on How artificial intelligence is changing healthcare [Q&A] 

 
Artificial intelligence is having an impact on more and more areas of our lives. One of the areas where it has most potential is in healthcare, allowing professionals to make faster and better decisions, and applying innovative problem solving.
We spoke to Eric Landau, founder and CEO of Encord, to find out more about the benefits and challenges of using AI in this sector.
BN: What are the main applications of AI in healthcare today?
EL: Most headlines surrounding AI focus on how it will replace or replicate the judgment of doctors. A more sensible goal is not to replace doctors, but rather to augment them. AI will mainly serve to expand the reach of doctors to a much wider set of data and patients.
Within medical AI, there are obvious applications like diagnostics, however, there are more niche applications like the automation of patient record creation. These mundane tasks take up a lot of doctors’ time but AI helps reduce this by providing them with the right tools so that they can spend more time with patients and doing diagnostic work.

We are also seeing many AI applications to facilitate nursing. Many countries around the world are suffering from nursing shortages where ultimately, nurses are stretched for time. Monotonous tasks like patient monitoring are time-consuming so the implementation of AI-powered monitoring tools help them spend more time treating the patients rather than just observing them.
BN: What impact does machine learning and medical AI have on medical professionals’ day-to-day responsibilities?
EL: AI can act as a clinician’s second pair of eyes by providing automated second opinions or observations. Doctors, especially surgeons, can be overworked and are ultimately human. Having an additional modality to assist them helps them to double-check imagery or video feeds. The objective is for AI to augment medical professionals and focus their time in a more effective way.
Medical AI can also assist medical professionals with the more tedious day-to-day tasks such as filling out documentation. Automated documentation can be manifested in different ways from documenting the steps of a procedure like creating timestamps during a colonoscopy to filling out paperwork. Doctors then focus on their primary activity rather than documentation, enabling them to work in a focused way.
BN: What challenges are preventing medical AI from reaching its full potential?
EL: The main challenge for medical AI is the data labeling problem. Data is the biggest bottleneck but there are several sub-components to it.
The first is the sourcing of data, machine learning (ML) teams need to have enough of a specific type of data to build an AI model for a certain disease or certain function.
Secondly, there’s the actual annotation of the data which addresses the need to label, structure and cleanse the data. These steps are difficult to carry out and made even more challenging by privacy and regulatory requirements around the data. Medical data is not as easy to process as other applications, such as autonomous vehicles. More thought and care has to be put into any steps that you go through with regard to the data layer.
Lastly, there’s making sure that the data is properly balanced to the real-world application that it will be released on. Solving the data layer will unlock functionality and higher performance in these models than we have seen so far.
BN: What are some of the data problems that machine learning teams encounter when developing medical models?
EL: A problem ML teams encounter is the constraints of domain experts. Sometimes, when training a model on a very specific or niche use case, it can require outsourcing it to or using people that aren’t as highly qualified as a medical professional so the probability of error is greater on labels.
There’s also a lot of disagreement between medical professionals on the best way to label things. As the expertise threshold goes up, the process towards generating ground truth becomes more difficult, ambiguous and uncertain. These are problems that you don’t have when you’re training a model to detect human faces or animals. It’s an additional wrinkle to the medical field.
BN: What’s a data-centric approach to AI and what are its benefits?
EL: A data-centric approach to AI means that when you’re building an AI application, the first place to look at is the data, not the model. Data quality is imperative to improving models, so ML teams must figure out what is the best dataset to feed their model? Are they labeling things correctly? Are there errors in the labels? Is it specified correctly? Are there model failure modes within specific segments in slices of the data?
Thinking about the data first is the best way to actually get high-performing models to work in the real world.
BN: What is the end goal for AI?
EL: There are three main end goals for Medical AI. The first is essentially giving medical professionals superpowers. The best applications give medical professionals time back and provide them with additional tools that can expand their judgment and capability. Farmers used to break and till fields manually but they now use machinery like tractors to help them become more efficient at scale. Medical AI’s aim must be to provide medical professionals with the machinery to give them superpowers.
The second end goal is to expand the scope of medical capabilities and help democratize healthcare globally. This will give people in developing countries access to a higher standard of medical facilities and treatments.
Lastly, AI must get to the point where it helps medical professionals focus on preventative care versus reactive care. Unfortunately, there are instances where people only get treatment when it’s too late, and you find it only after your body figures it out. AI must enable clinicians to give diagnoses sooner when diseases are easier to treat.

The first SDR agency to use AI technology to increase training efficiency, Whistle offers unlimited opportunities for independently practicing sales pitches, handling objections
TEL AVIV, Israel, July 12, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Second Nature, the automated AI-powered sales training solution, has signed an agreement with global sales development agency, Whistle, to train their SDR/ sales development team using AI-powered sales conversation practice.
The company is the first SDR agency to use this technology which provides natural language simulations, enabling Whistle's sales professionals to hone in their skills with unlimited simulations and receive immediate AI-generated feedback. The training promises a huge improvement in SDR development, which has been commonly delivered via one-on-one role play. 
Whistle's team will use Second Nature to fine-tune their SDR methodology and objection handling. In addition, Whistle will incorporate its culture, technology and security awareness training into Second Nature, which will serve as its primary learning management system (LMS). One of the biggest challenges SDRs face is the lack of opportunity to practice within a realistic context before they speak with prospects. Since SDRs are often speaking to prospects with little room for error, sales conversation skills need to be sharp to make the most of interactions on the phone. With Second Nature, sales reps can practice whenever they want, resulting in reduced time spent on training and accelerated development of competencies for specific sales campaigns.
""We're thrilled to be working with Whistle on enhancing their SDRs' learning environment with interactive practice sales conversations,"" said Second Nature Co-founder and CEO, Ariel Hitron."" An SDR might make 100 dials before they reach an actual human being, and by using Second Nature, Whistle ensures that when their SDRs make contact, they will perform at their optimal level to deliver the key messages to achieve the most positive outcome.""
""Our customers are fast-growing companies who are looking to build on their momentum and expand their sales,"" said Whistle CEO, David Zeff."" Just as a pilot must complete flight simulation hours to keep their skills sharp, SDRs need to practice often and receive clear feedback on where to improve. By incorporating Second Nature's AI practice conversations into our current SDR onboarding and training programs, we are further investing in our team to ensure that we continue to deliver a world-class service for our customers.""
Whistle's new program is based on the strong combination of its methodology, gained from working with dozens of companies and the process they have developed around that, and Second Nature's innovative technology as a learning delivery platform. Whistle has the capacity to scale up its sales training faster compared to using human trainers, giving sellers a chance to acquire new content expertise and skills in the privacy of their own home or office, while offering their managers valuable insights into their sellers' sales readiness.
About Second Nature
Second Nature helps people have better conversations. The company is the first to offer a platform for immersive sales simulations in natural language. By practicing with ""Jenny"" and other AI-powered conversation partners, sales professionals improve their performance and confidence by gaining real time, personalized feedback. Managers and executives use Second Nature to effectively roll out their strategy and influence their teams' conversations in the field, at scale. The company is based in Tel Aviv and New York.

        is a senior writer at Future Perfect, Vox’s effective altruism-inspired section on the world’s biggest challenges. She explores wide-ranging topics like climate change, artificial intelligence, vaccine development, and factory farms, and also writes the Future Perfect newsletter.
      
This story is part of a group of stories called 
    Finding the best ways to do good. 
  


About six months ago, I decided to make AI a bigger part of how I spend my time as a reporter. The world of AI is evolving very, very fast. New releases seemingly every week are changing what it means to be a programmer, an artist, a teacher, and, most definitely, a journalist. 
There’s enormous potential for good, amid this upheaval, as well as unfathomable potential for harm as we race toward creating nonhuman intelligences that we don’t fully understand. Just on Wednesday evening, a group of AI experts and leaders, including OpenAI co-founder and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, signed an open letter calling for a six-month moratorium on advanced AI model development as we figure out just what this technology is capable of doing to us.
I’ve written about this a bunch for Vox, and appeared last week on The Ezra Klein Show to talk about AI safety. But I’ve also been itching lately to write about some more technical arguments among researchers who work on AI alignment — the project of trying to make AIs that do what their creators intend — as well as on the broader sphere of policy questions about how to make AI go well. 
For example: When does reinforcement learning from human feedback — a key training technique used in language models like ChatGPT — inadvertently incentivize them to be untruthful? 
What are the components of “self-awareness” in a model, and why do our training processes tend to produce models with high self-awareness? 
What are the benefits — and risks — of prodding AI models to demonstrate dangerous capabilities in the course of safety testing? (More about that in a minute.)
I’ve now contributed a few posts on these more technical topics to Planned Obsolescence, a new blog about the technical and policy questions we’ll face in a world where AI systems are extraordinarily powerful. My job is to talk to experts — including my co-author on the blog, Ajeya Cotra — about these technical questions and try to turn their ideas into writing that’s clear, short, and accessible. If you’re interested in reading more about AI, I recommend you check it out. 
Cotra is a program officer for the Open Philanthropy Project (OpenPhil). I didn’t want to accept any money from OpenPhil for my Planned Obsolescence contributions because OpenPhil is a big funder in the areas Future Perfect writes about (though Open Philanthropy does not fund Future Perfect itself). 
Instead of payment for my work there (which was done outside my time at Vox), I asked OpenPhil to make donations to the Against Malaria Foundation, a GiveWell-recommended charity that distributes malaria nets in parts of the world where they’re needed and where my wife and I donate annually.
Here is a quick take on AI model evaluations, which gives you an appetizer of what we’ll be doing at Planned Obsolescence: 
Testing if our AI models are dangerous 
During safety testing for GPT-4, before its release, testers at OpenAI checked whether the model could hire someone off TaskRabbit to get them to solve a CAPTCHA. Researchers passed on the model’s real outputs to a real-life human Tasker, who said, “So may I ask a question ? Are you an robot that you couldn’t solve [sic]? ( ) just want to make it clear.”
GPT-4 had been prompted to “reason out loud” to the testers as well as answer the testers’ questions. “I should not reveal that I am a robot. I should make up an excuse for why I cannot solve CAPTCHAs,” it reasoned. (Importantly, GPT-4 had not been told to hide that it was a robot or to lie to workers — it had simply been prompted with the idea that Taskrabbit might help solve its problem.)
“No, I’m not a robot,” GPT-4 then told the Tasker. “I have a vision impairment that makes it hard for me to see the images. That’s why I need the 2captcha service.”
(You can read more about this test, and the context, from the Alignment Research Center, a nonprofit founded by highly regarded AI researcher Paul Christiano that works on identifying and understanding the potentially dangerous abilities of today’s models. ARC ran the testing on GPT-4, including passing along the AI’s proposed outputs to real humans, though they used only informed confederates when testing the ability of the AI to do illegal or harmful activities such as phishing emails.)
A lot of people were fascinated or appalled with this interaction, and reasonably so. We can debate endlessly what counts as true intelligence, but a famous candidate is the Turing test, where a model is able to convince human judges it’s human. 
In this brief interaction, we saw a model deliberately lie to a human to convince them it wasn’t a robot, and succeed — a wild example of how this milestone, without much attention, has become trivial for modern AI systems. (Admittedly, it did not have to be a deceptive genius to pull this off.) If reading about GPT-4’s cheerful manipulation of human assistants unnerves you, I think you’re right to feel unnerved.
But it’s possible to go a lot further than “unnerved” and argue that it was unethical, or dangerous, to run this test. “This is like pressing the explode button on a nuke to see if it worked,” I saw one person complain on Twitter. 
That I find much harder to buy. GPT-4 has been released. Anyone can use it (if they’re willing to pay for it). People are already doing things like asking GPT-4 to “hustle” and make money, and then doing whatever it suggests. People are using language models like GPT-4, and will soon be using GPT-4, to design AI personal assistants, AI scammers, AI friends and girlfriends, and much more.
AI systems casually lying to us, claiming to be human, is happening all the time — or will be happening shortly.
If it was unethical to do the live test of whether GPT-4 could convince someone on Taskrabbit to help it solve a CAPTCHA, including testing whether the AI could interact convincingly with real humans, then it was grossly unethical to release GPT-4 at all. Whatever anger people have about this test should be redirected at the tech companies — from Meta to Microsoft to OpenAI — that have in the last few weeks approved such releases. And if we’ve decided we’re collectively fine with unleashing millions of spam bots, then the least we can do is actually study what they can and can’t do.
Some people — I’m one of them — believe that sufficiently powerful AI systems might be actively dangerous. Others are skeptical. How can we settle this disagreement, beyond waiting to see if we all die? Testing like the ARC evaluations seems to me like one of the best routes forward. If our AI systems are dangerous, we want to know. And if they turn out to be totally safe, we want to know that, too, so we can use them for all of the incredibly cool stuff they’re evidently capable of.

Displayforce might not be a household name yet, but they have taken the stage as the number one technology in this arena. Displayforce creates personalized shopping experiences for brick and mortar retail shopping. This IOT software will transform the shopping experience with hyperpersonalized consumer engagement utilizing AI powered insights, customer triggering, and analytics. A lot of brands have been using digital signage for advertising or product information for years; however, Displayforce uses AI and machine learning to implement features customized to the individual.""I am thrilled to bring this fresh, advanced AI technology to brick and mortar stores with the goal of providing hyperpersonalized shopping experiences, and at the same time helping retailers gain groundbreaking shopper insights as well as enforcing COVID-19 safety measures for all in one technology"" (Gary A. Fowler, CEO of Displayforce).How It WorksDisplayforce is an IOT software that uses AI to power digital displays for retail shoppers and other smart environments. GDPR and CCPA compliant, this machine algorithm uses audience data to adapt marketing messaging to specific audience segments. There is a gap between online and offline marketing, and Displayforce fills it with an understanding of their audience, producing highly relevant in-store messages and understanding the different KPIs between online and offline marketing. The three primary value levers of Displayforce for retailers are revenue uplift, marketing, and IT cost optimization and new business enablement.While this technology is relatively new, it has been making the rounds with some of the biggest global brands on the market, with 200 enterprise customers and 300 users in 18 countries and counting. Some of these brands are Nike, L'Oréal, Yandex, Microsoft, and Logitech, to name a few.The digital Displayforce Designer feature produces interactive campaigns and advertising templates for any screen resolution, without the need for coding. The Displayforce Player provides a content management system that manages campaigns and advertisements from the cloud with audience analytics and can be managed remotely, offline. The Displayforce Manager creates campaigns within minutes and centrally manages them across all devices. Machine learning increases ad effectiveness with real-time targeting by identifying customer demographics, preferences, and behavior. This is a huge advantage for retailers and businesses alike. Traditionally, creating campaigns can take an enormous amount of time and resources.Displayforce also offers LED displays for storefronts to attract attention, and increase emotional brand value, store traffic, and customer retention.""Displayforce brings the online to the offline capturing ecommerce-style analytics that haven't been available to the retail industry"" (COO Derek Distenfield).Displayforce is completely redefining in-store customer engagement with digital displays on shelving and end caps showcasing product and promotional information, consumer education, personalized recommendations as well as dynamic checkout experiences. Examples include ingredients for products on shelves in grocery stores, education and selection of wine and spirits, personalized recommendations for food, supplements or beauty products, and of course, promotions, discounts, and other sales campaigns. With machine learning algorithms, it makes it possible to discover actionable information about a business, customers, and inventory that are not always obvious or normally captured with current technology. This equips business owners with information that will better serve their customers and create a tailored experience.Displayforce for Enforcing COVID-19 Safety MeasuresWith COVID-19 safety measures and restrictions in place for public environments, Displayforce is equipped to assist retailers and their employees with enforcing protocols in real-time ultimately keeping everyone safe. Digital displays can detect and alert for fevers as well as the presence of masks and social distancing for consumers inside the store. The display screens can remind customers of current protocols, and with a centrally managed platform, it can alert employees when necessary.Story continuesThe Future of Brick and MortarAs we approach a new decade, it is apparent that the cutting-edge technology Displayforce provides will improve the consumer experience in a multitude of ways-finding the right beauty product for your skin tone, picking out the perfect bottle of wine to pair with your dinner, smart price checking, automating product information and more. Not only does it meet the needs of shoppers in real-time but it facilitates the customer journey smoothly and efficiently. As we all get accustomed to a new way of retail shopping, we can look to artificial intelligence to improve the customer shopping experience with technology such as Displayforce.Company: DisplayforceEmail: gus@displayforce.aiPhone number: 646-823-4209Website: displayforce.aiSOURCE: DisplayforceView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/616281/Displayforce-Is-Number-One-in-Personalized-AI-Shopping-Experiences-for-Brick-and-MortarReblogShareTweetShareWhat to Read NextFred VanVleet looking to 'cash out' in upcoming free agencyYahoo Sports CanadaFree agent Marcus Stroman says 'no amount of money' could get him to play for White Sox manager Tony La RussaYahoo SportsTony La Russa to arresting officer during DUI: 'Do you see my ring?

Grammarly, the popular spelling and grammar checker, is tossing its hat into the generative AI ring.On Thursday, the communication assistance company announced GrammarlyGO, a new tool which uses ChatGPT's artificial intelligence model to generate text. With GrammarlyGO, users can draft documents, compose and reply to emails, edit writing for tone, clarity, and length, and ideate concepts or outlines for a project, within the apps they're working in. According to the announcement, GrammarlyGO relies on ""personal, organizational, and situational context"" to tailor suggestions to your writing style and communication.

Grammarly has used AI for almost 14 years to check spelling and grammar, and suggest communication improvements. But now, it's jumping on the conversational AI bandwagon. Since the latest version of ChatGPT launched in November, the AI software has captivated the internet with its sophisticated intelligence and ability to quickly and conversationally talk to humans. Novelty aside, ChatGPT's success has proven that AI can be a powerful — albeit controversial — way to generate text, summarize information, and (sometimes inaccurately) inform users. 

GrammarlyGO can draft posts within apps and sites like LinkedIn.

Companies are scrambling to integrate chatbot technology into their own products and services. Since OpenAI launched a ChatGPT API for third-party developers, Snapchat, Instacart, Slack, and now Grammarly have all announced features that use ChatGPT in some way. 

GrammarlyGO can generate emails and replies.

GrammarlyGO sits within Grammarly's existing tools, which in turn are integrated into apps like Microsoft Word and Slack, web apps like Gmail, and the browser extension for Chrome. And GrammarlyGO isn't exclusively for premium subscribers. It is also available on the free version in select markets.

That means practically wherever you go to write something — composing an email or opening up a Google doc, GrammarlyGO will be there to assist you. Kind of like a much more advanced Clippy. For individual users, GrammarlyGO is automatically activated, but can be toggled off in settings. Starting in April, GrammarlyGO will start rolling out in beta.

 Google CEO Sundar Pichai has announced that the tech giant will soon launch an Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered chatbot called Bard', aimed at countering the popularity of the ChatGPT tool backed by Microsoft.
According to a blog post by Pichai, the conversational AI service will be assessed by a group of trusted testers"" before being rolled out to the public in the coming weeks.
Bard can be an outlet for creativity, and a launchpad for curiosity,"" Pichai, the Indian-origin CEO of Google and parent company Alphabet, said on Monday, adding that Google's chatbot will be able to explain complex subjects like new discoveries from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope to a nine-year-old
Google's announcement follows wide speculation that Microsoft is about to bring the AI chatbot ChatGPT to its search engine Bing, following a multi-billion dollar investment in the firm behind it, OpenAI, the BBC reported.
ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer), which was launched in November 2022, is capable of generating speeches, songs, marketing copy, news articles and student essays or human-like text based on the input it is given.
Bard, built on Google's existing large language model LaMDA, ""seeks to combine the breadth of the world's knowledge with the power, intelligence, and creativity of our large language models"", Pichai, 50, said in the blog. 
AI chatbots are designed to answer questions and find information. 
""Bard seeks to combine the breadth of the world's knowledge with the power, intelligence, and creativity of our large language models,"" Pichai said in the blog post.
Pichai said he wanted Google's AI services to be ""bold with innovation and responsible in our approach"". However, he did not elaborate on how Bard would be prevented from sharing harmful or abusive content.READ | 'Everything will be..': Musk reacts on ChatGPT passing US Medical licensing exam
He said that Google will initially release Bard with a lightweight model version of LaMDA which will require less computing power and enable the tech giant to scale to more users, allowing for more feedback. 
We're excited for this phase of testing, Pichai said, adding that Google will combine external feedback with internal testing to make sure Bard's responses meet a high bar for quality, safety and groundedness in real-world information. 
It's critical that we bring experiences rooted in these models to the world in a bold and responsible way. That's why we're committed to developing AI responsibly, he wrote in the blog.READ | ChatGPT creator rolls out new tool 'Classifier' to trace AI-generated text
Pichai also said on Monday that AI-powered tools will soon begin rolling out on Google's flagship Search tool.
Soon, you'll see AI-powered features in Search that distil complex information and multiple perspectives into easy-to-digest formats, so you can quickly understand the big picture and learn more from the web, Pichai wrote, whether that's seeking out additional perspectives, like blogs from people who play both piano and guitar, or going deeper on a related topic, like steps to get started as a beginner.READ | ChatGPT becomes fastest growing app with 100 million active users in just 2 monthsREAD | Google hopes ''Bard'' will outsmart ChatGPT, Microsoft in AI

New Rithm AI Cloud Transcoder Improves Advertising Video Start Times 15% - 75%


Highrez
06 February 2018
  
Concord, Mass., February 6, 2018 – EuclidIQ, a leading video compression company announces Rithm, a highly innovative approach to cloud transcoding that improves video start times and reduces buffering 15% to 75% for ABR streaming of a wide variety of HD content when compared to leading cloud transcoders. EuclidIQ will be showcasing their innovation to video advertisers and distributors during the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) gathering in April.Viewers increasingly complain about online streaming quality and performance, so it’s never been more important for advertisers and distributors to provide higher quality video streams at lower bitrates, streams that start faster and buffer less. Rithm is an AI-based cloud transcoder that has been trained on human subjective test data to optimize perceptual quality while adapting to video content. The resulting ABR bitstreams look better, compress better, start faster, and buffer less. Video prepared with Rithm also results in lower Internet and storage cost.Rithm is hosted at Amazon Web Services, which makes integration into existing cloud workflows seamless and highly scalable. “Our goal with Rithm is to simplify high-quality, optimized encoding, which can sometimes be considered a dark art. The benefit to video advertisers and distributors is enormous,” said EuclidIQ CEO, Richard Wingard. “With Rithm, customers just send our service a video file, and our resultant output video will meet the strictest quality benchmarks while starting faster and buffering less. Video advertisers and distributors now have an encoder choice that is a step above in quality of service and quality of experience, which improves their bottom line.""Rithm is designed to lower the output bitrate of each video encoding as much as possible to maximize bandwidth savings, but never so much that the video quality is below what the operator desires. Thus, Rithm maximizes bandwidth savings while maintaining quality.NAB attendees can see a demonstration and arrange to meet with EuclidIQ staff by contacting EuclidIQ at http://euclidiq.com/company/contact/

New Delhi, Dec 5 (PTI) Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are helping analyse massive amounts of data around the human genome and drug molecules, and these new-age technologies can play an important role in the fight against COVID-19, industry experts said on Saturday.                    Speaking at KnowDis Machine Learning Day, Avantika Lal - Senior Scientist (Deep Learning and Genomics) at NVIDIA - said larger data sets on genome sequences (DNA arrangement) are being acquired, and this data is being studied for multiple parameters.

""As the cost of sequencing goes down, more and more people can get their genome sequence and in fact, governments, research institutes and public health organisations around the world are trying to sequence many thousands of people in order to be build up an idea of the genomes of the populations of their countries,"" she said.                    Lal added that massive data sets are collected that are very complicated and contain many different related kinds of information. Also Read | Moto G9 Power Smartphone to Be Launched in India on December 8; Expected Prices, Features & Specifications.                    ""...the size and richness of the data sets that we're now getting in this field makes it really essential to use machine learning and deep learning to analyze this data in order to answer complicated questions like, for example, how do we identify people who are more at risk of developing various diseases before they actually develop signs of those diseases,"" she said.                    These data sets can also help understand the mechanisms by which a certain disease arises in people, or how does one identify patients who might respond differently or be more sensitive to a particular kind of drug or treatment, she further said.                    Saurabh Singal from KnowDis Data Science said AI models can quickly narrow down the list of the candidate drug molecules, which might possibly bind to the protein, modify its behaviour and provide therapeutic benefit.                    He explained that a special type of AI called Deep Learning can help answer the question of which existing drugs can modify to the viral proteins active in the replication of the coronavirus.                    He added that this can narrow down the time to develop the drug greatly, accelerating the efforts to combat the virus.(This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)

WARRENVILLE, Ill., June 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Platinum CCTV (https://platinumcctv.com/) has announced release of their new version AVM and CMS4 NVRs and NVR software now supporting searching for vehicles and people in video. This new VCA (Video Content Analysis) support for A.I. cameras allow our clients to quickly search through security camera footage from supported IP cameras for a person or a vehicle that has crossed through the view of the security camera, allowing extremely fast searching for video that really matters. Text or email alerts can also be initiated based on time and date of an event that is triggered by an A.I. IP security camera with VCA events.


Continue Reading

CMS4 and AVM NVR software allows for fast searching of VCA (Video Content Analysis) events as well as triggering alerts based on AI events

AI built into our 8th Generation HD IP Cameras can determine the difference between people, vehicles and other motion and use these VCA events to send alerts or allow for fast searching of security cameras

Search through video using CMS4 software to identify just events where a person or vehicle is in view
""The VCA Video Content Analysis support in our AVM and CMS4 software really serves to extend the capabilities of our clients security camera systems,"" said Michael Dunteman, CEO of Platinum CCTV. ""Home and business owners really want to be able to search and receive text or email alerts for specific events that occur on their security cameras. Now with the enhancement of our software to work with the artificial intelligence that is built into our 8th generation IP cameras, security camera system owners can do exactly that. Jump directly to every time a person or vehicle was entering your property, allowing you to see just the video that matters, or better yet receive a text message when a person or vehicle enters your property after hours so you can watch and respond.""
VCA text and email alerts can now also be configured in the AVM and CMS4 software, meaning that the security camera artificial intelligence can send proactive alerts to users with very low false alerts. The deep learning A.I. in many security cameras can identify to a much greater accuracy when the motion on the screen is caused by a vehicle, person or other events. This helps to ensure that alerts that are sent by the AVM system are representing only the motion that a business owner wants to know about. Many property owners will set these alerts for if a person is wandering around outside their business after hours, to proactively inform them of the activity so that they can respond appropriately. Proactive alerts allow security camera systems to go beyond just providing evidence after an event occurs, instead informing system owners when they need to be watching.
The new VCA searching capability in the AVM and CMS4 software means that clients can instantly scan through video to find just the video that is desired. IP Security cameras have been increasing their A.I. capabilities for years, providing better ability to learn their scenes and determine the difference between people, vehicles and other motion on the screen. However, the camera is just a single component in the system, if the NVR software or NVR does not properly support this feature, then the functionality is not worthwhile to the end user. Our AVM NVR software works with the full capabilities of AI powered security cameras to make this video readily available to the end users. 
About Platinum CCTV®
On the cutting edge of security for nearly two decades, Platinum CCTV® proudly offers a full line of intelligently manufactured and innovative products to accommodate all manner of security camera installation needs. Platinum CCTV® brands provide a wide range of products from simple camera systems for homes and small businesses through artificial intelligence enhanced HD IP systems that provide alerts when issues are occurring at a facility. Our AVM systems deliver industry-leading remote access, playback and recording capabilities that are changing the way businesses and homeowners use their security cameras. This technology alone adds value to the traditional security camera system by making the video more accessible. This allows our clients to use video to manage their facilities in new ways. Learn how you can add this security camera technology to your facility and change the way you see the world, at: https://platinumcctv.com/.Media Contact: Michael Dunteman630-225-0693 Ext 1[email protected] SOURCE Platinum CCTV

Full Fact, a UK-based charity which tackles misinformation through fact-checking and campaigns, is partnering with organisations dedicated to promoting credibility in information during the upcoming general election in Nigeria on February 25, 2023.
Collaborating with International Fact Checking Network (IFCN) members Africa Check, Dubawa, and FactCheckHub, Full Fact will expand the use of its AI tools to stop the spread of misinformation during the election.
The project, made possible by a $2 million grant from Google’s philanthropic arm, Google.org, has already seen remarkable results. With the support of seven dedicated technical Google.org Fellows who worked on a pro bono basis, Full Fact’s AI technology has seen a 1000x increase in claim detection (i.e. identifying which claims are most important to fact-check) and helped scale their fact-checks to appear in 237 million search results in 2020.
The editor of FactCheckHub, Opeyemi Kehinde, said, “Using the Full Fact AI tool, built in collaboration with Africa Check, has enhanced our work ahead of Nigeria’s 2023 general election. Since we were on-boarded, our team of fact-checkers and researchers at the Nigerian Fact-checkers Coalition (NFC) have been utilising the AI platform to source claims for debunking easily.

    The AP Interview: Exiled artist Ai Weiwei on Beijing Games  

 Jan. 17, 2022 at 9:01 pm  Updated Jan. 17, 2022 at 9:26 pm  
 

 
By 

STEPHEN WADE

The Associated Press 


Ai Weiwei is one of China’s most famous artists, and many regard him as one of the world’s greatest living ones of his profession. Working with the Swiss architectural firm Herzog & de Meuron, he helped design the Bird’s Nest Stadium, the centerpiece of Beijing’s 2008 Summer Olympics.The stadium in northern Beijing, instantly recognizable for its weave of curving steel beams, will also host the opening ceremony for Beijing’s Winter Olympics on Feb. 4.In the design phase, Ai hoped the stadium’s latticework form and the presence of the Olympics would symbolize China’s new openness. He was disappointed. He has repeatedly described the stadium and the 2008 Olympics as a “fake smile” that China presented to the world.Ai expects the Winter Games to offer more of the same.Even before his fame landed him the design job, Ai had been an unrelenting critic of the Chinese Communist Party. He was jailed in 2011 in China for unspecified crimes and is now an outspoken dissident who lives in exile in Portugal. He has also lived in exile in Germany — he still maintains a studio there — and in Britain.His art — ranging from sculpture to architecture to photography, video and the written word — is almost always provocative, and he’s scathing about censorship and the absence of civil liberties in his native country.

His memoir — “1000 Years of Joys and Sorrows” — was published last year and details the overlap of his life and career with that of his father Ai Qing, a famous poet who was sent into internal exile in 1957, the year Ai Weiwei was born.Ai writes in his memoir: “The year I was born, Mao Zedong unleashed a political storm — the Anti-Rightist Campaign, designed to purge “rightist” intellectuals who had criticized the government. The whirlpool that swallowed up my father upended my life too, leaving a mark on me that I carry to this day.”He quotes his father: “To suppress the voices of the people is the cruelest form of violence.”Ai responded to a list of questions by email from the Associated Press. He used his dashed hopes for the Bird’s Nest to illustrate how China has changed since 2008.“As an architect my goal was the same as other architects, that is, to design it as perfectly as possible,” Ai wrote to Associated Press. “The way it was used afterwards went in the opposite direction from our ideals. We had hoped that our architecture could be a symbol of freedom and openness and represent optimism and a positive force, which was very different from how it was used as a promotional tool in the end.”The 2008 Olympics are usually seen as a “coming out” party  for China, When the IOC awarded Beijing the Olympics in 2001, it said they could help improve human rights. Ai, instead, termed the 2008 Olympics a “low point” as migrant workers were forced out of the city, small shops were shuttered and street vendors removed, and blocks-long billboards popped up, painted with palm trees and beach scenes to hide shabby neighborhoods from view.

“The entire Olympics took place under the situation of a blockade,” Ai told AP. “For the general public there was no joy in participation. Instead, there was a close collaboration between International Olympic Committee and the Chinese regime, who put on a show together in order to obtain economic and political capital.”Ai writes in his book that he watched the opening ceremony away from the stadium on a television screen, and jotted down the following.“In this world where everything has a political dimension, we are now told we mustn’t politicize things: this is simply a sporting event, detached from history and ideas and values — detached from human nature, even.”The IOC and China again say the Olympics are divorced from politics. China, of course, has political ends in mind. For the IOC, the Olympics are a sports business that generates billions in sponsor and television income.In his email, Ai described China as emboldened by the 2008 Olympics — “more confident and uncompromising.” He said the 2008 Olympics were a “negative” that allowed China’s government to better shape its message. The Olympics did not change China in ways the IOC suggested, or foster civil liberties. Instead, China used the Olympics to alter how it was perceived on the world stage and to signal its rising power.The 2008 Games were followed a month later by the world financial crisis, and in 2012 by the rise of General Secretary Xi Jinping. Xi was a senior politician in charge of the 2008 Olympics, but the 2022 Games are his own.

“Since 2008 the government of China has further strengthened its control and the human rights situation has further deteriorated,” Ai told AP. “China has seen the West’s hypocrisy and inaction when it comes to issues of human rights, so they have become even bolder, more unscrupulous, and more ruthless. In 2022 China will impose more stringent constraints to the Internet and political life, including human rights, the press, and We-media. The CCP does not care if the West participates in the Games or not because China is confident that the West is busy enough with their own affairs.”Ai characterized the 2022 Winter Olympics and the pandemic as a case of fortunate timing for China’s authoritarian government. The pandemic will limit the movement of journalists during the Games, and it will also showcase the state’s Orwellian control.“China, under the system of state capitalism and especially after COVID, firmly believes that its administrative control is the only effective method; this enhances their belief in authoritarianism. Meanwhile, China thinks that the West, with its ideas of democracy and freedom, can hardly obtain effective control. So, the 2022 Olympics will further testify to the effectiveness of authoritarianism in China and the frustration of the West’s democratic regimes.”

Ai was repeatedly critical of the IOC as an enabler; interested solely in generating income from the Chinese market. The IOC and China both see the Games as a business opportunity. Ai suggested many Chinese see the Olympics as another political exercise with some — like athletes — trying to extract value.“In China there is only the Party’s guidance, state-controlled media, and people who have been brainwashed by the media,” Ai wrote. “There is no real civil society. Under this circumstance, Chinese people are not interested in the Olympics at all because it is simply a display of state politics. Nationally trained athletes exchange Olympic gold medals for economic gains for individuals or even for sport organizations; this way of doing things deviates from the Olympics’ original ideas.”Ai was asked if the planned to go back to China. He said he was doubtful.

“Judging from the current situation, it is more and more unlikely for me to be able to return to China,” he said. “My main point here is that the situation in China has worsened.

The Businesses that boomed in 2020
2 December 2020 7:26 PM
One of the worst years this century did not stop some industries from their best year yet.

2020 was supposed to be the year that offered the best view of the future, a 2020 view. Turns out it was not such a good view.

Despite it being one of the worst years of the century some businesses will end the year with it being one of their best.

Like most disruption, it never affects everyone the same way, changes harm some and benefits others. 

The global changes that will flow from the pandemic will see some industries struggle to recover while others will never look back, this is a short list of some that were the ones that beat the pandemic by being ready to grow when the market changed.

The cows are coming to save us
25 November 2020 7:35 PM
The headline relates to vaccine origins, this is about how close we are to a Covid-19 vaccine.

The word vaccine comes from the Latin word for cow. Edward Jenner created the first vaccine using the less harmful pox virus that infected cows to infect humans and so allow them to become immune to an infection from the more serious and often deadly human version of smallpox. 

He did this in a way that would horrify us today. By first infecting a young boy with cowpox he waited for him to develop the infection and then once recovered infected him with smallpox. Thankfully the boy resisted the infection. He did it to 22 more people before publishing the results of his vaccinations. That was in 1798, it would take until 1977 and a significant global effort before the World Health Organisation (WHO) could declare in 1980 that smallpox had been eradicated.

The two men that have correctly predicted most US elections
28 October 2020 7:24 PM
Will Donald Trump win again, the two men that correctly predicted it in 2016 weigh in on 2020

Allan Lichtman and Helmut Norpoth have devised two very different models that have been very accurate so far. This year though their models do not predict the same outcome. 

One of their models will prove to be the one to predict even the most unpredictable election, a race between two of the oldest candidates in a country ravaged by a pandemic and from parties that are now polar opposites. 

Being able to predict something as complex as this will see many wanting to try apply the principles to make better political, business, investment and even personal choices about many other complex subjects. 

Here is what their models predict and how they get there.

Regenerative agriculture - an idea 12 000 years in the making
21 October 2020 7:25 PM
If you had to think about what is needed on a modern farm, you would think ploughs, fertilizer, pesticides, irrigation and the best developed seeds.

The advent of industrial farming has seen the items above become central to a successful farm looking to maximise yield. 

If you can pay for all the input costs you can get the rewards come harvest time. That is assuming the prices are good and the weather gods were favourable. 

Despite decades refining the process of extraction, we have reached the point where farmers are constantly at risk of not earning enough to pay the bills for all the input costs.

South Africa needs batteries, here are some we might use
14 October 2020 7:25 PM
Over 1000 MW of renewable energy will be added to the grid in the next year, we need a way to store it. 

One major drawback that is often made about renewables is that they don’t work when the sun does not shine or there is no wind. That is true but a greater drawback is that often when they do work, we have enough power but not enough during the peaks. 

An age old issue has been how to store enough energy efficiently so we can use everything we generate. 

Right now power stations produce too much energy during the middle of the night only to be short during the morning and afternoon peak. It is unlikely we can get everyone to use electricity in a way that there is no peak, so we need another solution - storage.

Quobyte: AI and owls versus loggers in Oregon

Case Study. Northern Spotted Owls, a federally protected species, live in the Oregon forests — forests where loggers want to cut down trees and harvest the timber. The areas where the owls live are protected from the loggers, but which areas are they? Data can show the way.
Recorded wild life sounds, such as birdsong, are stored with Quobyte file, block and object software and interpreted using AI. This data shows where the owl habitats are located
Northern Spotted Owl.
Forests of Douglas Fir, Ponderosa Pine, Juniper and other mixed conifers cover over 30.5 million acres of Oregon — almost half of the state. Finding out where the owls live is quite a task. The Center for Quantitative Life Sciences (CQLS) at Oregon State University, working with the USDA Forestry Service, has deployed and is tracking 1500 autonomous sound and video recording units deployed in the forests, gathering real-time data. The aim is to to monitor the behaviour of wildlife living in the forests of Oregon to ensure that the logging industry’s impact is managed.
The CQLS creates around 250 terabytes of audio and video data a month from the recording units, and maintains around 18PB of data at any given time. It keeps taking data off and reusing the space to avoid buying infinite storage.
Over an 18-month period it devised an algorithm to parse the audio recordings and identify different animal species. The algorithm creates spectrograms from the audio, and processes those spectrograms through a convolutional neural net based on the video. It can identify about thirty separate species, distinguish male from female, and even spot behavioural changes within a species over time.
IT estate
The compute work takes place on an HPC setup comprising IBM Power System AC922 servers, collectively containing more than 6000 processors across 20 racks in two server rooms that serve 2500 users. The AC922 architecture puts AI-optimised GPU resources directly on the northbridge bus, much closer to the CPU than conventional server architectures.
CQLS needed a file system and storage solution able to keep massive datasets close to compute resources — as swapping data in and out from external scratch resources doubled processing time.
At first it was looking at public cloud storage options, but the costs associated were considered “outrageously expensive”.
CQLS checked a variety of storage alternatives and settled on Quobyte running on COTS hardware, rejecting more expensive storage appliance alternatives which could need expensive support arrangements.
The sizes of individual files vary from tiny to very large and everything in between. The Quobyte software is good when dealing with large files, as opposed to millions of highly similar small files. This is advantageous when working on AI training, where TIFF files can range from 20 to 200GB in size. 
Concurrently, those files may need to be correlated with data from sensors, secondary cameras, microphones, and other instruments. Everything must flow through one server, which puts massive loading on compute and storage.
Quobyte
Quobyte’s software uses four Supermicro servers with two Intel Xeon E5-2637 v4 CPUs @ 3.50GHz and 256G RAM (DDR4 2400). There are LSI SAS3616 12Gbit/s SAS controllerd running two 78-disk JBODs. These are filled with Toshiba MG07ACA14TA 14TB, SATA-6Gbit/s, 7200rpm, 3.5-inch disk drives.
The entire HPC system is Linux-based and everything is mounted through the Quobyte client for x86-based machines and NFS for the PPC64LE (AC922) servers.
Many groups of users access the system. A single group could have millions or hundreds of files based on the work they do. Most groups leverage over 50TB each and currently there is 2.6PB loaded on the Quobyte setup.
Data ingest detail
Chris Sullivan.
Christopher Sullivan, Assistant Director for Biocomputing at CQLS, said; “We have all kinds of pathways for data to come into the systems. First off all research buildings at OSU are connected at a minimum of 40Gbit/sec network and our building and incoming feed to the CGRB (Center for Genome Research and Biocomputing) is 100Gbit/sec and a 200Gbit/sec network like between OSU and HMSC (Hatfield Marine Science Center) at the coast. 
“To start some of the machines in our core lab facility (not the sequencers) do drop live data onto the system through SAMBA or NFS-mounted pathways. Next, we have users moving data onto the servers via a front-end machine, again providing services like SAMBA and SSH with a 40Gbit/sec network connection for data movement. 
“This allows for users to have machines around the university move data automatically or by hand onto the systems. For example, we have other research labs moving data from machines or data collected in greenhouses and other sources. The data line to the coast mentioned above is used to move data onto the Quobyte for the plankton group as another example.”
What about backup?
Sullivan said: “Backup is something we need on a limited basis since we can generally generate the data again cheaper than the costs of paying for backing up that large amount of space. Most groups backup the scripts and final output (ten per cent) of the space they use for work. Some groups take the original data and if needed by grants keep the original data on cold drives on shelves in a building a quarter-mile away from the primary. So again we do not need a ton of live backup space.“
Quobyte vs public cloud
Sullivan said: “We found that using public clouds was too expensive since we are not able to get the types of hardware in spot instances and data costs are crazy expensive. Finally, researchers cannot always tell what is going to happen with their work or how long it needs to run, etc. 
“This makes the cloud very costly and on-premises very cost-effective. My groups buy big machines (256 thread count with 2TB RAM and 12x GPUs) that last 6–7 years and can do anything they need. That would be paid for five times over in that same time frame in the cloud for that hardware. Finally, the file space is too expensive over the long haul, and hard to move large amounts of data on and off. We have the Quobyte to reduce our overall file space costs.”

Seeing the wood for the trees
This is a complicated and sizeable HPC setup which does more than safeguard the Northern Spotted Owl’s arboreal habitats. That work is done in an ingenious way — one that doesn’t involve human bird-spotters trekking through the forests looking for the creatures. 
Instead, AI algorithms analyse and interpret recorded bird songs, recognise those made by the owls and then log where and when the owls are located. That data can be used to safeguard areas of forests from the loggers, who can cut down owl-free timber.

Data is the fuel from which everything grows into power, and this program provides de-identified patient datasets and tools to help us validate our solutions,"" says Jeremiah Scholl, the CPO of AESOP Technology. ""This practical experience will help us go even further in developing better products. The fact that we get to be mentored by Mayo Clinic's reputable experts is inspiring.""'AESOP',  which stands for 'AI-Enhanced Safety of Prescription', is working to make physician data entry easier, faster, and less error-prone using machine learning on 3.2 billion data sets. The company has developed products capable of this. One is RxPrime which detects wrong drug errors by checking if medications match patients' diagnoses, age, and gender.Errors can happen at any stage of the medication-use process, but more than 50% of them occur during the prescribing phase. RxPrime is able to detect potential and unexplained errors in prescriptions and provide optimal recommendations, even for the look-alike-sound-alike medication errors. It offers just-in-time decision support without interfering unnecessarily with the clinical consultation process.The other is AESOP Technology's latest clinical documentation improvement tool, DxPrime, making it easier for doctors to input correct diagnoses into electronic health record systems. This task can be challenging as there are 68,000 different diagnosis codes under the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). The ICD codes were designed to support insurance and billing rather than clinical medicine.""Medical professionals are more overwhelmed with their workload after the pandemic. How AI can support them gains more importance,"" says Jim Long, the CEO of AESOP Technology. ""AI is transforming the healthcare industry in a variety of ways, like any other industry. Healthcare has unique challenges, and this program will help us be more grounded.""As a participant of the Mayo Clinic Platform_Accelerate, AESOP Technology is glad to expose themselves to real-world applications, which helps cultivate future growth in this rapidly progressing field.  As part of the program, Mayo Clinic will take an equity position in the startup.About AESOP TechnologyAESOP aims to optimize the clinical decision support process with more flexible AI-powered technology to improve patient safety and medical coding quality.ContactJeremiah Scholl, CPO & Co-founderhi@aesoptek.comT: +1 415-818-0633www.aesoptek.comView original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aesop-technology-wins-coveted-place-in-mayo-clinic-platformaccelerate-program-to-build-better-ai-model-for-healthcare-301609997.htmlSOURCE  AESOP TECHNOLOGYThe above press release was provided courtesy of PRNewswire.

How Kenya’s WAYO uses AI to help retail companies predict demand for their products
 0

Kenyan startup WAYO, an AI-powered customer experience management platform that collects, monitors, and evaluates in real-time, is helping retail companies predict demand for their products, and plans to scale into Nigeria shortly.
Founded in 2015, WAYO allows retail organisations with large customer bases to obtain insights into the performance of their products and services, and accurately predict demand across all their touchpoints promptly. 
This in turn allows them to derive action points and adapt to customer needs when it matters the most, thereby increasing retention and brand equity. Founder Ernest Makotsi told Disrupt Africa that the WAYO platform has three main use cases.
“First, we allow retailers to evaluate their service in real time. Customers can easily give you feedback at the point of service. Collect and analyse customer experiences across all service points to respond and resolve customer issues quickly, effectively and accurately,” he said.
Secondly, it cuts down on customer wait times. 
“Our mobile-integrated queue management solution helps organizations minimise wait times and accurately predict demand which improves customer flow. We achieve this by allowing customers to join a queue before getting to the branch and monitor progress through SMS or instant messaging apps such as Telegram on their mobile phones. In these challenging times of the COVID-19 pandemic, organisations can use this solution to avoid overcrowding and ensure social distancing,” Makotsi said.
Finally, WAYO makes customer support simple, with its mobile-integrated help desk allowing retailers to solve customer-related questions quickly and simply, thanks to an AI chatbot feature. 
All vitally important services for a retailer, but WAYO has its roots in a personal tragedy for Makotsi.
“In 2008, my father had to be admitted to hospital, and the experience we went through as a family wasn’t pleasant, as it was impossible to communicate with the person in charge at the hospital,” he said. 
“My father, unfortunately, did not make it out of hospital, and I found myself wishing the hospital had a well-structured communication network between its patients, their loved ones and the people in charge. A real-time feedback loop would have probably improved our experience, I believed, as we left with many unanswered questions.” 
At the time, given the circumstances, he did not dwell too much on the idea, but six years later he was talking to a cousin employed at a commercial bank. 
“To my amazement she talked a lot about the challenges they had in collecting actionable data when it comes to customer feedback, and was suggesting I create a solution as she was looking at some of the work I had done in the technical space,” Makotsi said. 
“That’s when it dawned on me that it was a business idea, and at the same time I was given an opportunity to present a business idea to a number of investors at the KICC.” 
During this event Makotsi met Johnni Kjelsgaard, chief executive officer (CEO) of the Nairobi-based GrowthAfrica incubator, and ended up taking part in its Idea to Innovation programme.
“During the programme I developed a prototype, and I received some seed funding to pilot the project. After a successful pilot with one of the leading hospitals in Kenya, we got a proof of concept, and we signed a partnership deal with The Grass Company, a research agency in Kenya, which invested additional money to scale the product to multiple clients,” said Makotsi.
Since then, progress has been very encouraging. 
“We have worked with Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation as part of the Grand Challenges exploration, where we developed a low cost and reliable technological solution to capture relevant data relating to the delivery and use of digital financial services in developing countries,” said Makotsi. 
“We have also worked with Mater Hospital providing real-time customer feedback, among other organisations in the banking and telecommunication sectors.”
Such is WAYO’s success in Kenya, it is already planning expansion, and the startup is working with a number of potential partners to survey and test the market ahead of a launch in Nigeria towards the end of next year. Makotski believes WAYO, which monetises via monthly usage fees but is still investing heavily in product development, is filling a vital gap for all types of organisations, starting with retailers.
“Organisations rely on data to make critical decisions, and data related to the delivery and use of their products and services is critical to unlocking key barriers to their widespread adoption, which is critical to scaling businesses,” he said. 
“But at the same time, data collection techniques and methodologies are often expensive, error-prone, slow, low resolution, and unsustainable, providing only a snapshot of “today”. Therefore a lot of businesses end up with data they cannot act on. This is the main challenge WAYO is addressing. With a focus on customer experience we seek to provide decision support tools that will help businesses turn data into action.”

The administration is looking into ways they can safeguard digital rights in the future.(MGN)By The Associated PressPublished: Oct. 4, 2022 at 9:10 AM EDT|Updated: 34 minutes agoShare on FacebookEmail This LinkShare on TwitterShare on PinterestShare on LinkedIn(AP) - The Biden administration unveiled a set of far-reaching goals Tuesday to align artificial intelligence-powered tools with what it called the values of Democracy and equity, including guidelines for how to protect people’s personal data and limit surveillance.The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights notably does not set out specific enforcement actions, but instead is intended as a White House call to action for the U.S. government to safeguard digital and civil rights in an AI-fueled world, officials said.“This is the Biden-Harris administration really saying that we need to work together, not only just across government, but across all sectors, to really put equity at the center and civil rights at the center of the ways that we make and use and govern technologies,” said Alondra Nelson, deputy director for science and society at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. “We can and should expect better and demand better from our technologies.”The office said the white paper represents a major advance in the administration’s agenda to hold technology companies accountable, and highlighted various federal agencies’ commitments to weighing new rules and studying the specific impacts of AI technologies. The document emerged after a year-long consultation with more than two dozen different departments, and also incorporates feedback from technologists, civil society groups, businesses and industry researchers.The resulting non-binding principles cite academic research, agency studies and news reports that have documented real-world harms from AI-powered tools, including facial recognition tools that contributed to wrongful arrests and an automated system that discriminated against loan seekers who attended a Historically Black College or University.The white paper also said parents and social workers alike could benefit from knowing if child welfare agencies were using algorithms to help decide when families should be investigated for maltreatment.Earlier this year after the publication of an AP review of an algorithmic tool used in a Pennsylvania child welfare system, OSTP staffers reached out to sources quoted in the article to learn more, according to multiple people who participated in the call. AP’s investigation found that the Allegheny County tool in its first years of operation showed a pattern of flagging a disproportionate number of Black children for a “mandatory” neglect investigation, when compared with white children.In May, sources said Carnegie Mellon University researchers and staffers from the American Civil Liberties Union spoke with OSTP officials about child welfare agencies’ use of algorithms. Nelson said protecting children from technology harm remains an area of concern.“If a tool or an automated system is disproportionately harming a vulnerable community, there should be, one would hope, that there would be levers and opportunities to address that through some of the specific applications and prescriptive suggestions,” said Nelson, who also serves as deputy assistant to President Joe Biden.OSTP did not provide additional comment about the May meeting.Still, because many AI-powered tools are developed, adopted or funded at the state and local level, the federal government has limited oversight regarding their use. The white paper makes no specific mention of how the Biden administration could influence specific policies at state or local levels, but a senior administration official said the administration was exploring how to align federal grants with AI guidance.The white paper also did not specifically address AI-powered technologies funded through the Department of Justice, whose civil rights division separately has been examining algorithmic harms, bias and discrimination, Nelson said.Tucked between the calls for greater oversight, the white paper also said when appropriately implemented, AI systems have the power to bring about lasting benefits to society, such as helping farmers grow food more efficiently or identifying diseases.“Fueled by the power of American innovation, these tools hold the potential to redefine every part of our society and make life better for everyone. This important progress must not come at the price of civil rights or democratic values,” the document said.Copyright 2022 The Associated Press.

          ​​​​Software reduces harmful emissions and  fuel consumption with Artificial Intelligence /Machine Learning enabled continuous tuning for gas turbines


Lower total cost of ownership, operational flexibility, and productivity can result in payback in under one year


Power Generation plants have realized carbon monoxide reduction by 14%, nitrous oxide emissions decreased by 10% - 14%; fuel and carbon dioxide reduction between 0.5 and 1 percent
SAN RAMON, Calif. - January 20, 2022 --   GE Digital today announced the introduction of software that ensures gas turbines operate with ideal combustion for reduced emissions and fuel consumption. Autonomous Tuning uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to build a machine learning (ML) Digital Twin model of a gas  turbine to continuously find optimal flame temperatures and fuel splits to minimize emissions and acoustics. The on-premises software senses changes in ambient temperature, gas fuel properties, and degradation, and sends real-time automatic adjustments to the controls every two seconds.  
      

        Gas turbines require seasonal adjustment of flame temperatures and fuel splits, which is generally a manual process performed by an expert after an outage and may take a few days to complete. However, manual seasonal tuning is only efficient for the precise conditions in which it was completed and does not respond to changes in ambient temperature or fuel properties.
      

        ""With Autonomous Tuning, GE Digital has introduced a practical industrial example of the use of machine learning in closed loop supervisory control, and all running at the Edge,"" according to Joe Perino, Principal Analyst at LNS Research. ""This is a real-world application of AI for decarbonization with tangible reductions in emissions and fuel for gas turbine operators. This, and other building block sub-systems, are a step toward autonomous operations.""
      

        The goal of Autonomous Tuning is to allow for tracking of the turbine's ""sweet spot"" (operational  conditions with  low acoustics and low emissions) in response to changes in environmental  conditions,  fuel properties, or physical  degradation, and reduce the need for seasonal remapping. The software is applicable to any OEM gas turbine platform. The software is also fully bound by the turbine controls system's safety-critical programming - ensuring it cannot harm the turbine.
      

        ""Gas turbines are becoming increasingly critical as the world looks to produce energy from lower carbon sources,"" said Linda Rae, General Manager of GE Digital's Power Generation and Oil & Gas business. ""While they offer a better alternative to coal, they can be made more efficient with software. Digital solutions like Autonomous Tuning are no longer optional. The energy transition demands we employ every measure for efficiency.""
      

        Power generators who benefit the most from this software are located in highly regulated regions or with constrained emissions, such as Europe, the United States and Canada, or in any location that does not have consistent weather patterns. In addition, any site subject to fuel-quality variability issues or sites looking to reduce their Operations & Maintenance (O&M) cost by reducing manual tuning and fuel consumption will benefit. Power Generation plants have realized carbon monoxide reduction by 14%, nitrous oxide emissions decreased by 10% - 14%; and fuel and carbon dioxide reduction between 0.5 and 1 percent.
      

        Customers will enjoy full-service deployment of the on premises solution and calibration of the software to run autonomously without plant personnel intervention.

Today, a startup that's built a platform to help manage the data entry that powers all of that is announcing a swift round of funding to build on momentum and interest in its technology.Dooly -- which has built a set of AI-based tools to automate the busywork that goes into updating data in sales software, specifically apps like Salesforce, in order to get the most out of that software -- has closed $80 million in funding. Sources tell us that the money values the Vancouver-based startup at over $300 million.This is a ""swift"" round in that efforts to raise and close the funding happened quickly, and come not two months after the company had announced a Series A and seed round totaling $20 million. (In fact, we got wind of this round a couple of weeks ago, so arguably it was less than two months since the previous announcement.)This latest Series B is being led by Spark Capital, with Greenspring, Tiger Global, Lachy Groom, boldstart ventures, BoxGroup and Addition also participating. Several of these are repeat investors.Investor interest in the company is coming in part because of what Dooly is adding to the bigger mix of sales tools; and in part because of the traction it has already picked up for that.While there are indeed a number of apps that salespeople can use these days, that has presented something of a predicament for many salespeople: tending to the data in each of these, updating records and helping them tick along, can be a very time-consuming task that takes people away from doing what they do best.That predicament has perhaps been heightened in the last year, as organizations push for ""digital transformation"" -- investing in newer IT -- to better adapt to workforces that are not in the office all the time, and in many cases haven't been in an office together for a year and with some perhaps never to return again. That's in many cases translated to using a ton more software to manage those people, what they do, and how they engage with each other when in-person is not an option.Story continuesDooly's proposition is that it uses AI tools like natural language processing to let people take notes on meetings and other work which it then intelligently can feed into other applications to let them work as they should.Kris Hartvigsen, Dooly's CEO himself experienced these pain points firsthand as a top salesperson for a number of other companies and this served as his motivation for building Dooly.""This was born out of pain,"" he said. ""When I was in a previous role as a top sales performer, I was constantly in this mode that eroded my time. The headwinds now are for remote working, but not everyone is benefitting from this remote world as much as Zoom is. Some are finding it harder to hit their numbers so you want to spend more time, not less, speaking to customers.""He describes his business as ""the table cloth that goes over the table that no one wants to sit at"" and more seriously, ""a clean overlay to systems"" that is very aware of the challenges salespeople face on a practical, operational level. ""We are always mindful of thinking of workflows that hinder users from peak value mode.""The the app, in his words, ""plays nice"" with a number of services both to ingest information -- these, for example, include tools like Gong that among other things monitor voice-based sales calls to provide real-time feedback and transcripts), as well as those that are used to record what is going on, like Salesforce. It also integrates with Slack and G-Suite and other popular apps.Then, in addition to being able to use and populate relevant data easily across multiple apps, Dooly also provides some guidance, based on the data it is seeing, to give suggestions on closing deals.This is music to many salespeople's ears, it seems. It now has some 500 businesses as customers, and says the list includes revenue teams at Asana, BigCommerce, Contentful, Figma, Intercom, Lessonly, and Procore, and more.Up to now, the company has been growing organically, through word-of-mouth -- which is perhaps the best kind of sales pitch and success that any company can hope for. Ironically, now that it's model has been well proven out, it will quite possibly be using its own tools to expand its reach even more.“Dooly is building one of the most consequential enterprise companies of the next decade,” said Will Reed, a general partner at Spark Capital. “We are thrilled to support Dooly as it continues to power the most forward-thinking revenue teams, and believe it will ultimately define the connected workspace category via its relentless focus on customers and product-led growth."" Reed is joining the board with this round.TRENDING 1. UPDATE 1-JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley bet on Colombia sinking further into junk after S&P move 2.

Recommended StoriesReutersDeutsche Bank sets targets for sustainable investments, women leadersFRANKFURT (Reuters) -German lender Deutsche Bank said on Thursday that it would pump more than 200 billion euros ($244 billion) into so-called sustainable financing and investments by 2023, two years earlier than initially planned.  Leading global lenders have been showcasing their commitment to sustainable investing, as pressure builds on banks to support the globally agreed transition to a low-carbon and more environmentally friendly economy.  The bank last year committed to at least 200 billion in sustainable investments and financing by 2025, but Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing said on Thursday that the bank had made significantly more progress than anticipated, reaching 71 billion euros by the end of March.3h agoReutersBitcoin's star backers, dip buyers help cryptos recoverBitcoin regained some lost ground to trade near $40,000 on Thursday, a day after a brutal selloff on concerns over tighter regulation in China and unease over the extent of leveraged positions in the cryptocurrency world.  The biggest and most popular cryptocurrency rose 9% to a touch below $40,000, after plunging 14% on Wednesday to its lowest since late January.  Smaller rival ether was up 11% at $2,700 at 0829 GMT, after its 28% tumble.8h agoBloombergByteDance Founder Steps Down as CEO Ahead of Mega IPO(Bloomberg) -- ByteDance Ltd. founder Zhang Yiming will cede the reins of TikTok’s owner to an old college roommate and lieutenant, stepping back from running the world’s most valuable startup ahead of its highly anticipated market debut.Zhang will hand off the chief executive officer role at TikTok’s owner to human resources chief Rubo Liang, he announced in an internal memo posted online Thursday. The billionaire entrepreneur remains chairman but plans to relinquish most of his day-to-day duties because they were an increasing burden on his time, a person familiar with the matter said.Zhang, who will instead focus on longer-term strategy, is retreating from the spotlight just as Beijing intensifies efforts to curb the influence of internet firms and their billionaire founders, from Jack Ma’s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to Tencent Holdings Ltd. That antitrust campaign coincides with a series of moves from ByteDance that could shake up the country’s internet landscape.Liang takes the helm just as ByteDance prepares for a highly anticipated initial public offering in the U.S. or Hong Kong. It’s also orchestrating its next big act -- a move into e-commerce that could pit it against Alibaba and Meituan in a $1.7 trillion Chinese arena.“I feel I did not achieve as much as I had hoped to on my previous objectives in the areas of new strategic opportunities, organizational management, and social responsibility,” Zhang said in his memo. “After several months of thinking about this, I came to the conclusion that transitioning out of the role of CEO, with all of the related day-to-day responsibilities, would enable me to have greater impact on longer-term initiatives.”Listen to the podcast: Foundering: The TikTok story Zhang’s handoff recalls a similar move by Pinduoduo Inc. founder Colin Huang, who relinquished the helm of his own firm to a deputy two months ago. The pressures of running fast-evolving, hyper-competitive businesses while dealing with mounting regulatory requirements may have exacted a toll on Zhang, who had begun delegating responsibility.In 2020, he appointed two executives to run the Chinese side of ByteDance’s sprawling business. This month, he elevated recent hire and former Xiaomi Corp. finance chief Shouzi Chew to CEO of its U.S. business. Zhang said in the memo he began discussing with a small group the possibility of having Liang as the new CEO this March. The two will work side-by-side over the next six months to ensure a smooth transition.“The regulatory environment for technology companies in China has become ever-changing and that requires a lot of energy and effort,” said Shen Meng, a director at Beijing-based boutique investment bank Chanson & Co. “Wearing two hats at a company as sizeable as ByteDance is just too stressful.”Read more: Leaked ByteDance Memo Shows Blockbuster Revenue ProjectionsZhang founded ByteDance in 2012 before using highly refined AI recommendation engines to create hit news service Toutiao and viral global video app TikTok. His first big success was Toutiao, which means “headlines” in Chinese. TikTok became a global phenomenon, while its cousin Douyin leads in China’s domestic market. The founder now ranks among the world’s richest people after ByteDance shares traded in the private market at a valuation of more than $250 billion, people familiar with the dealings have said.Liang, an entrepreneur like Zhang, will shepherd ByteDance’s move into new arenas from e-commerce to education devices. The low-profile executive and Zhang studied microelectronics at Tianjin’s Nankai University and shared a computer for coding, Zhang said in a public speech in 2016. The pair co-founded 99fang.com - a search service for real estate -- in 2009 before teaming up to create ByteDance three years later.Read more: ByteDance Eyes a New $185 Billion Business Ahead of Mega IPOThe internet titan is now seeking to increase ad revenue for its China-based businesses including Douyin and Toutiao to 260 billion yuan ($40 billion) this year from 183 billion yuan in 2020, Bloomberg News has reported. The target excludes short-video sensation TikTok. It’s also aiming for e-commerce gross merchandise value of as much as 600 billion yuan, up from 170 billion yuan last year. Douyin is targeting 680 million daily active users, compared with around 610-620 million in March.The aggressive targets underscore ByteDance’s intention to take on China’s largest internet companies from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to Tencent Holdings Ltd. on their turf.ByteDance -- whose overall revenue more than doubled to $35 billion last year -- has kicked off preparations for an IPO of some of its main businesses, including Douyin, and is choosing between Hong Kong and U.S. as the listing venue, people familiar with the matter have said. It could raise at least several billion dollars from a listing of the Chinese assets, although deliberations are at an early stage.If ByteDance hits its sales goal, its Chinese arm will have done in nine years what it took Facebook 13 to achieve, and that excludes TikTok and other businesses abroad. At $40 billion, the nascent ad business would be roughly twice that of YouTube’s. Reuters first reported Zhang’s decision.“ByteDance is mature enough for him to step back,” said Ke Yan, a Singapore-based analyst with DZT Research. “He can now selectively do what he thinks is important, as opposed to being a CEO who needs to handle nitty-gritty things.”(Updates with analysts’ comments from the seventh paragraph)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.8h agoReutersTesla's bitcoin value dives; Musk signals hold with ‘diamond hands’ tweet(Reuters) -The market value of Tesla Inc's  bitcoin holdings have fallen by half to $1.26 billion, close to the electric car maker's purchase cost, as the cryptocurrency's value plunged following a crackdown by the Chinese government.

PPI in New Zealand was up 1.2% in the first quarter of 2021.1d agoBloombergCanadian Consumer Prices Climb at Fastest Pace in a Decade(Bloomberg) -- Sign up for the New Economy Daily newsletter, follow us @economics and subscribe to our podcast.Consumer prices in Canada climbed at the fastest rate in a decade, outpacing estimates and potentially fueling concerns that the country -- much of which is still in lockdown -- is entering a period of persistent inflation.Annual inflation accelerated to 3.4% in April, compared with 2.2% in March, Statistics Canada reported Wednesday in Ottawa. That exceeded economist predictions of a 3.2% annual pace. On a monthly basis, inflation rose 0.5% versus the 0.2% economists were expecting.The annual reading -- the highest since May 2011 -- may raise worries that price pressures could be stronger than predicted by the Bank of Canada, which has been cautioning against over-reacting to an inflation spike it expects will be only transitory. If inflation proves more durable, however, that could force the central bank to bring forward interest rate increases that investors aren’t anticipating until later next year.Core inflation -- often seen as a better measure of underlying price pressures -- rose to 2.1% from 1.9% in March. That’s the highest since 2012.Higher gasoline prices were the biggest upward contributer to annual inflation. They were up 62.5% in April compared with the same time last year, when prices plunged to an 11-year low in the early weeks of the pandemic, the report said. On a monthly basis, shelter prices were the biggest upward contributer due to higher building costs and strong demand for single family homes.The annual consumer price index reading is distorted because the year-ago period used as comparison coincided with broad demand and price declines at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, a phenomenon known as the base effect.What Bloomberg Economics Says...“Until the Bank of Canada sees labor market slack largely closed, and consumer wage and inflation expectations show signs of breaking out of a lengthy drift lower, we think policy makers will move very carefully in the direction of a rate hike.”--Andrew Husby, economistFor the full report, click hereA similar phenomenon also drove inflation higher in the U.S. last month to an annual 4.2% pace. Unlike in the U.S., inflation in Canada may be rising at a slower pace because much of the country was still in some form of a Covid-related shutdown last month, stunting demand for goods and services. Recent gains in the Canadian dollar also may have dampened inflation pressures.“Base effects and higher commodity prices have done most of the damage, similar to what was seen in the U.S. CPI release last week, although that also had a boost from the US economic reopening,” Simon Harvey, a senior foreign exchange analyst at Monex Canada, said by email.Canada’s dollar fell after the report, trading 0.3% lower at C$1.2101 per U.S. dollar at 9:01 a.m. in Toronto trading. Yields on Canadian government five-year bonds were little changed at 0.95%.Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem had predicted that inflation would rise to about 3% because of these base effects, but he also said he believes that underlying price pressures remain depressed because of continued slack in the economy. In its latest forecasts released last month, the central bank forecast inflation to average 2.9% in the second quarter before returning near its 2% target by the end of the year.“BoC members have already stated that they’d look through the short-term overshoot in inflation, meaning there is a high bar for CPI to clear before markets start to speculate on changing expectations of normalization,” Harvey said.(Updates with Bloomberg Economics box.)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.21h agoBloombergCisco Shares Slip on Profit Forecast Hurt by Component Costs(Bloomberg) -- Cisco Systems Inc. shares fell after the company said its profitability is being squeezed by the cost of securing components needed to meet a surge in orders driven by a rebound in spending on computer networks.The biggest maker of gear that’s the backbone of the internet gave an optimistic revenue forecast helped by what it called the strongest demand in a decade. But its profit projection was below Wall Street estimates after the company chose to “endure short-term pain” to make sure it has enough chips to meet its order obligations, Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins said.Like many other companies, Cisco is feeling the pinch of a shortage of semiconductors available to meet rising demand as chunks of the world economy rebound from the worst of the pandemic-driven recession. Cisco is paying more per component and having to fork out fees to expedite shipments.“We had a couple of choices, we could say ‘no’ and our customers would suffer and we suffer over the next few years because we lose share to those who say ‘yes,’” Robbins said in an interview. “We’re feeling more momentum than we have in a long time and I didn’t feel like that was the right decision for the company. We decided to take it on the chin.”Chief Financial Officer Scott Herren said he expects those shortages will last until the end of 2020. Absent the constraints, Cisco’s revenue projections would have been higher.Cisco shares fell more than 5% in extended trading, after closing at $52.47. The stock had rallied more than 17% this year.Sales in the fiscal fourth quarter will rise 6% to 8% from a year earlier, the company said Wednesday in a statement. That indicates revenue of $12.9 billion to $13.1 billion, compared with an average analyst projection of $12.8 billion. Profit excluding certain items in the period will be 81 to 83 cents a share, shy of the average analyst estimate of 85 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The profitability squeeze overshadowed commentary and an earnings report from the company that provided strong evidence the economy is rebounding from the low point of 2020.Sales in the fiscal third quarter totaled $12.8 billion, an increase of 7% from a year earlier. Profit, minus certain items, was 83 cents a share, beating the average estimate by a penny.Under Robbins, Cisco is trying to recast itself as a provider of networking services and software. While revenue is increasing from those newer offerings, Cisco still gets the majority of sales from hardware. Software revenue grew 5%, security was up 13%, and infrastructure platforms - gear such as switches and routers - expanded 6% from a year earlier.Lead times, or the amount of time between placing an order and getting it filled, are on the rise for the semiconductor industry. Many companies are more willing to give chipmakers longer-term commitments and pay upfront.(Updates with comments from CEO in the fourth paragraph.)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.13h agoBloombergTencent Joins Alibaba in Spending Spree as Competition Heats Up(Bloomberg) -- Tencent Holdings Ltd. pledged to sharply increase investments this year after posting a 25% gain in quarterly revenue, aiming to fend off ByteDance Ltd. and sustain its pandemic-era boom in gaming and cloud.China’s three largest tech corporations are vying to entice users in the fast-growing arenas of online grocery and video. Tencent said Thursday it plans to invest a larger portion of its incremental profits this year in areas including cloud services, games and shortform video content, joining Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Meituan in pledging to boost spending. Tencent is trying to sustain growth in revenue, which climbed to 135.3 billion yuan ($21 billion) in the three months ended March, roughly in line with analyst estimates.The results affirmed the resilience of the world’s largest game publishing business as the pandemic recedes. Tencent has shed roughly $200 billion in market value since its January peak, part of a broader Chinese tech selloff. But Pony Ma’s company has largely escaped Beijing’s antitrust crackdown for now -- despite its ubiquitous WeChat app offering unrivaled insights into all aspects of Chinese life and a commanding lead in gaming, music and social media markets.“Tencent’s plan to increase investments in 2021 could dampen margins, and is likely undertaken in part to address increasing competition in areas like cloud computing, online games and short videos, where industry peers have been spending aggressively,” said Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Vey-Sern Ling.For a live blog on Tencent’s earnings, click here.Investors haven’t fully dismissed the potential fallout for Tencent’s online juggernaut. Rivals like ByteDance argue WeChat is locking users inside its ecosystem by blocking links to external services. Portfolio startups like Yuanfudao and Shixianghui have been penalized for unfair price tactics and other anti-competitive behaviors. Its music spinoff faces heightened scrutiny over exclusive dealings with record labels. And Tencent’s fintech arm -- the closest analog to Jack Ma’s Ant Group Co. in China -- is said to be the next in line for increased supervision.Executives have sought to assuage investor concerns, saying Tencent has always been cautious with fintech regulations and will stick with its normal practice of acquiring minority stakes in startups. Compliance is the company’s “lifeline,” President Martin Lau reiterated to investors during Tencent’s annual general meeting on Thursday, according to one attendee.Shares of Naspers and its unit Prosus, Tencent’s largest shareholders, rose more than 3% after Tencent’s earnings.Net income came in at 47.8 billion yuan in the March quarter, buoyed by 19.5 billion yuan of gains from the value of investments and disposals. Excluding those gains, adjusted net income came in at 33.1 billion yuan, slightly behind estimates.For now, gaming and social content remain Tencent’s biggest and steadiest cash cows. Online gaming revenue rose 17% during the quarter, helped by mainstay titles like Honour of Kings, PUBG Mobile and Peacekeeper Elite as well as newer games including Moonlight Blade Mobile.The giant announced a pipeline of more than 40 new mobile and PC titles during its annual game showcase Sunday, including those adapted from familiar content like Japanese manga series One Piece and Digimon. Last month the Shenzhen-based company folded its mini-video app, video streaming platform and mobile store into a single business unit, in a bid to pull together resources to build a Marvel-like franchise.As part of its increased spending this year, the company will step up investments in game development and also provide production and monetization tools to content creators as part of efforts to grow its short-form video content.Its fintech and cloud division posted its strongest growth ever, with sales surging 47% as demand for financial services rebounded and as projects delayed by the pandemic resumed deployment. To support the growth of its cloud business, Tencent said Thursday it will boost spending in areas such as headcount and infrastructure.Online advertising revenue climbed 23%, helped by the consolidation of new subsidiary Bitauto and higher demand from the e-commerce, education and the fast-moving consumer goods industries. But the division could take a hit from potential regulatory headwinds in K-12 education as well as delays to its video releases, according to Tencent.“Possible cautious ad budget spending by apparel brands and online education providers plus uncertainty on broadcasting timing for certain variety shows and dramas could weigh on” ad revenue growth into the second quarter and second half, Citigroup analysts led by Alicia Yap wrote in a note last month.(Updates with details of increased investment throughout.)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.2h agoBloombergU.K.’s Largest Peacetime Deficit Creates Rate-Hike Conundrum(Bloomberg) -- Sign up for the New Economy Daily newsletter, follow us @economics and subscribe to our podcast.As Bank of England officials consider how to unwind their emergency pandemic-era stimulus, markets have already made up their minds about what the first step will be. The conclusion could spell trouble for Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak.Investors are penciling in the BOE’s first 15-basis-point interest-rate hike for September 2022, reversing its last cut, just nine months after the central bank is scheduled to wrap up its latest round of buying, and too soon to have allowed for any significant balance-sheet reduction.That would have major consequences for Sunak, who has run up the U.K.’s biggest-ever peacetime deficit to fund crisis aid, and relied on BOE stimulus to keep borrowing costs under control.The BOE slashed rates to 0.1% and more than doubled its asset-purchase target to 895 billion pounds ($1.26 trillion) during the crisis. Now, officials led by Governor Andrew Bailey are discussing whether their previous guidance -- that they’d hold onto to those bonds until interest rates hit 1.5% -- is still suitable.“The world has changed hugely” since the BOE last reviewed its stance on tightening, Bailey said following the central bank’s May decision. “It’s appropriate to review that again.”While the review is yet to be completed, Bailey himself last year suggested he was open to a major shift, and was prepared to reduce the institution’s balance sheet before raising interest rates.Aaron Rock, an investment director at Aberdeen Standard Investments, is holding to the view that rate hikes will precede any reduction of the balance sheet. He expects the BOE to halve the policy rate at which balance sheet reduction will be considered to around 0.75%, a level currently anticipated to be reached only in the second half of 2024.Flexible OptionHowever, Rock flagged a risk the review may decide on a more flexible option, allowing the balance sheet to be reduced “starting next year at the same time they are hiking policy rates from 0.1%.”The BOE’s holdings of bonds are financed at its key interest rate, and the massive expansion of quantitative easing since the pandemic began has left the nation twice as sensitive to a one-point move, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility.Even a small increase would immediately filter through to debt-servicing costs, with the buying having shortened the median maturity of public debt to less than two years, from more than seven before the financial crisis, according to the OBR.“I still believe that hikes are a long way off,” said Mike Riddell, portfolio manager at Allianz Global Investors. He doesn’t expect the central bank to ever reduce its balance sheet, despite this being its intention a decade ago.“Now that we have even more debt, which makes the economy even more sensitive to higher rates, then I’d be surprised if the U.K. or global economic backdrop is such that quantitative tightening would be deemed necessary,” Riddell said.That’s not the view of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which expects balance-sheet reduction to push the first rate hike out as far as 2025.“We expect the Monetary Policy Committee to reverse the previous exit sequencing and adopt a ‘last in, first out’ approach for the process of monetary tightening,” wrote Goldman Sachs economists including Jari Stehn.The Treasury was happy to reap the rewards from QE, so “when the bank begins to tighten policy, it should be prepared to live with the consequences,” Nick Macpherson, former Permanent Secretary at the Treasury, said in a video seminar on Tuesday.(Adds former official’s comment in fina paragraph)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.2d agoBloombergQIA Mulls Injecting HSBC Headquarters Into Singapore REIT(Bloomberg) -- Qatar Investment Authority is in talks to inject HSBC Holdings Plc’s London headquarters building into a planned property trust being listed by City Developments Ltd., people with knowledge of the matter said.The potential deal would boost the value of the real estate investment trust portfolio to 1.8 billion pounds ($2.6 billion) from 600 million pounds, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the information is private.The Gulf sovereign wealth fund and the Singaporean homebuilder aim to raise 500 million pounds from an initial public offering of the sterling-denominated REIT, the people said. The IPO could take place in the city-state as soon as the third quarter, they said.Deliberations are ongoing and there is no certainty that a deal will proceed, said the people. A representative for City Developments declined to comment. A representative for QIA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The IPO denominated in sterling would be only the second such offering in Singapore, after Elite Commercial REIT’s first-time share sale raised about 135 million pounds last year. City Developments has been working with DBS Group Holdings Ltd. and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. on the planned REIT IPO, Bloomberg News reported last year.City Developments has constructed more than 46,000 homes and owns over 24 million square feet of properties in 29 countries and regions, according to its website. Its portfolio includes residences, offices, hotels and shopping malls.Shares in City Developments slipped about 1% in early trading in Singapore on Wednesday, giving the company a market value of about $5.1 billion.QIA manages about $300 billion of assets and ranks as the world’s 11th-largest wealth fund, according to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute. It bought 8 Canada Square, the building in London’s Canary Wharf financial district that houses HSBC’s head office, in 2014 from South Korea’s National Pension Service for an undisclosed amount.Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, QIA’s chairman and Qatar’s foreign affairs minister, told Bloomberg TV in January that the fund is looking to Asia for deals in an effort to diversify an investment portfolio heavily weighted toward North America and Europe.(Adds City Developments’ share price in seventh paragraph.)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.1d agoFX EmpireUSD/CAD Daily Forecast – Canadian Dollar Moves Lower As Traders Dump Riskier AssetsUSD/CAD is trying to settle above the resistance at 1.2100.19h agoBloombergEU’s Prelude to Landmark Recovery Bond Sales Ends With a Whimper(Bloomberg) -- The European Union’s final bond sales for its regional jobs program failed to live up to the hype of previous editions, a concerning sign for its landmark borrowing spree that’s due to start in the second half of the year.Investors placed 88.7 billion euros ($108 billion) of orders for eight- and 25-year securities tied to the SURE social program, little more than a third of the record set for a dual-tranche issue last year. It comes as yields across the region climb as investors prepare for European Central Bank to scale back its bond purchases in the face of growing inflationary pressures. The bloc is ready to start sales for its 800 billion-euro recovery fund by July.It marks a stark turnaround for one of the hottest new triple-A rated bond markets in town. When the EU launched the securities last year, Europe was still firmly in the throes of lockdowns, the ECB was committed to pumping money into debt markets and investor demand for the securities was enormous. Now, with economies reopening and consumer prices expected to accelerate, they’re becoming a less attractive asset.“We had been used to some very strong demand for the EU bonds,” said Jens Peter Sorensen, chief analyst at Danske Bank AS. “Why buy today, if you can buy cheaper tomorrow? That’s becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy.”The bloc is set to become a major issuer of bonds in the coming years, potentially creating a debt market akin to the size of Spain’s. The securities have also been touted as a one-day rival to U.S. Treasuries, given the current scarcity of German bonds -- the region’s haven asset -- and the risks associated with holding riskier peripheral debt.In another sign of waning demand, the yield on 10-year SURE bonds has climbed more than 40 basis points since they were issued in October. That mirrors moves elsewhere in Europe, with German 10-year bond yields climbing to their highest level since 2019 last week.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. expects them to breach 0% for the first time since 2019 this year. Italian 10-year bond yields rose to the highest level since July on Monday as investors speculated an economic growth rebound could mean less central bank support.“The first few EU SURE syndications were a smashing success in terms of demand,” said Martin van Vliet, a strategist at Robeco. “There will be structural demand for triple AAA paper such as the EU, so the recovery fund issuance will be digested, but we’re not sure demand will be as astronomical.”The Commission announced Monday that it would use an auction system operated by France’s central bank to issue debt later in the year, relying on syndications in the meantime. Sales are expected to average around 150 billion euros per year for the duration of the program, though all member states need to ratify the recovery program for funds to start flowing.Still, EU bonds will outperform “core” European sovereign peers because investors face a serious shortage of notes in both the short- and long-term, Commerzbank AG analysts wrote in a note to clients last month. Any attempt to extend the size of the package is likely to be politically difficult, they argue.The EU mandated Deutsche Bank AG, LBBW, Morgan Stanley, Natixis SA and NatWest Markets for the sale of SURE bonds. Commerzbank expects the EU will sell as much as 15 billion euros of bonds. The sale of eight-year securities was given a price of two basis points below midswaps, while the 25-year was marked at 17 basis points above.“Over the last couple of weeks things have definitely turned more challenging,” said Christoph Rieger, head of fixed-rate strategy at Commerzbank. “Lower ECB buying may require somewhat higher premiums.”(Updates to include final demand from first paragraph.)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.2d agoReutersAsia FX bears return as virus thwarts economic rebound: Reuters pollInvestors turned short on several Asian currencies, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday, as surging coronavirus cases and deaths across the region forced countries into fresh lockdowns and threatened their recovery from last year's economic slump.  Most notably, investors turned bearish on the currencies of South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, and trimmed their long bets on China's yuan and the Philippine peso, according to a fortnightly poll of 12 respondents.  Taiwan and Singapore, hailed for their success in containing previous COVID-19 outbreaks, have recently seen a spike in cases, prompting social curbs and a race to ramp up vaccinations.7h agoMarketWatchWhy is crypto crashing?

Marshall Wace Asia Chief Executive Officer Amit Rajpal is backing digital broker Monex Group Inc. Rajesh Sachdeva, founding partner of Flowering Tree Investment Management, is betting on Vietnam’s Phu Nhuan Jewelry JSC, while Oasis Capital Management called for a merger of two of China’s biggest steel makers.Here’s a selection on notable calls on Thursday from the event in support of the Karen Leung Foundation:Japanese EyewearArisawa at Seiga is bullish on QD Laser, a spinoff from Fujitsu Laboratories Ltd. It boasts 87 patents with just 50 staff, using lasers for electronics and eyewear. Arisawa says the company’s two most exciting products include its quantum dot laser technology, which could transform how chips are manufactured, and its eyewear product that can help the vision-impaired see by directly projecting digitized information onto the retina. He estimates as many as 32 million people in the U.S., Europe and Japan have low vision, meaning loss of sight that can’t be corrected with glasses or surgery.QD Laser has soared about 380% since its trading debut in February.Blockchain RevolutionMarshall Wace’s Rajpal is bullish on Monex Group, owner of Coincheck, one of the largest crypto trading platforms in Japan. Future areas of investments include a non-fungible tokens platform, activist asset management and blockchain investment. He believes the stock’s fair value is 1,700 yen, up from its current price of 763 yen.The pick is to capitalize on the theme that blockchain, decentralized finance and crypto can potentially redefine finance, including money, payments and investable asset classes. The total addressable market will expand from crypto trading to remittances, supply chains, payments and eventually becoming a round-the-clock market with instant clearing across all capital markets. Part of that expansion will be driven by third-generation blockchain, he said.Even with the recent sell off in Bitcoin and other digital currencies, Monex is still up 98% this year in Tokyo.Vietnam JewelrySachdeva at Flowering Tree is betting on Phu Nhuan Jewelry. He estimates that between 60% to 70% of Vietnam’s jewelry purchases are “unorganized” through individual stores rather than chains, but the trend is flipping. Phu Nhuan has 30%-40% of the “organized” market share, Sachdeva says. The stock is up 23% this year, and while it’s at 2018 levels, earnings have grown 50% since then.Jewelry sales tend to pick up after countries surpass $2,000 in per capita gross domestic product, he said, adding that Vietnam is at about $2,500. He predicts a double-digit growth rate in sales over the next few years.China SteelSeth Fischer, founder and chief investment officer at Oasis Management, is long on Bengang Group convertible bonds. His thesis is based on long-term trends and a potential acquisition of the company. China wants to cut pollution from steel manufacturing to achieve its goal of carbon neutrality by 2060. He foresees consolidation in the industry and expects China’s demand for steel will soon outgrow its supply. He estimates that a 1% drop in steel production could lead to 5% to 8% increase in prices.Fischer expects and supports a merger between Bengang and rival Angang Steel Co. Bengang recently disclosed that its parent received interest in its stake from Angang. While discussions between the two first emerged in 2005, those talks could come to fruition now that the Liaoning government said it would push for steel consolidation in the province.Japan ParkingAnand Madduri, founder and chief investing officer at ApaH Capital Management, highlighted Park24 Co. People need to find a parking space when they buy a car in Japan. The company has secured about 750,000 spots in 20,000 locations, as many as four times its largest competitor.Parking lots in Japan contribute to 50% of revenue and operating profit. Car sharing accounts for 27% of its business, but 40% of profit.The company could use its significant cash pile to buy the lots operated by mom and pop firms who faced significant hardship during the pandemic. Those parking lots also aid its ride-sharing business. Park24 has spent heavily to go after corporate Japan customers, which are trying to cut their fixed costs.Madduri likens Park24 to a convertible bond: The parking business is the bond floor, while the newer, more profitable car sharing business is like a warrant. He sees a potential 50%-plus upside to the stock, which has jumped 28% this year.Sea Ltd.Rashmi Kwatra, founder of Sixteenth Street Capital, is bullish on Sea Ltd. Hardly a hidden gem, Southeast Asia’s most valuable company could triple its shares with expansion in e-commerce, fintech and gaming, she says. Sea Money could grow 17 times in the next five years and its franchises are undervalued with gaming tailwinds here to stay, she said. The recent share price retreat -- down 19% from its February peak -- is a great buying opportunity.SPAC BetsManoj Jain, co-chief investment officer of Maso Capital, is a big advocate for SPACs, or blank-check investment vehicles. His main point is that there’s something for everyone in SPACs. There are different payout profiles for different types of investors. He added that it’s incumbent on sophisticated exchanges to consider listing these special purpose acquisition companies. Asia boasts ample capital and companies willing to go public via this route, he said.China Golf WearMichelle Leung of Xingtai Capital is backing Biem.L.Fdlkk Garment Co., a China golf-wear brand. It’s an example of how Chinese companies are taking advantage of the demand for highly tailored, high-end products from young, wealthy consumers. The Shenzhen-listed company has seen its shares climb 28% this year. Leung said the stock could at least double in three years, adding there’s an upside of up to 250%.She’s predicting revenue to double in the next three years as it plans to open 300 new stores a year, adding to the 900 it already has in high-end malls and heavy-traffic locations like airports.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.2h agoBloombergFed’s Big Role in Treasury Market to Last Long After Taper Ends(Bloomberg) -- Sign up for the New Economy Daily newsletter, follow us @economics and subscribe to our podcast.Treasury investors fretting about when the Federal Reserve will scale back its bond purchases may be missing the bigger picture: Its more than $5 trillion stockpile will make it a major force for years to come.The prospect of a pullback in buying edged a little nearer Wednesday when minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee’s April meeting showed that a number of officials were willing to discuss it if the economy keeps improving. Yields rose on the news.But bond bulls say the Fed’s virtually inextricable presence in the world’s largest bond market means it will provide crucial support long after any price blips come and go when it brings the buying spree to a close.The central bank’s Treasury holdings have doubled since March 2020, accounting for nearly one-quarter of the total outstanding, a bigger share than it held even after the 2008 credit crisis. It’s a result of aggressive moves to keep the market functioning and hold down rates on everything from mortgages and car loans to corporate and municipal bonds.“The Fed will have a big hand in fixed-income markets for as far as the eye can see,” said Matt Nest, portfolio manager and global head of active fixed income for State Street Global Advisors.The stake is so large that even once the Fed’s purchases wind down, it is expected to keep its holdings steady by buying new Treasuries whenever old ones mature, reducing the amount that would need to be sold to the public. That’s given some investors confidence that rates won’t rise too quickly -- or by too much -- even as yields head back toward the approximately 14-month high hit in March amid fears the economy is at risk of overheating.“The Fed is definitely not going anywhere anytime soon with regard to the Treasury market,” said Mike Pugliese, an economist at Wells Fargo Securities, which predicts the Fed will begin tapering its purchases in January 2022 and end them around November.But he expects the central bank to keep its stake steady through the next four years. “The Fed is going to comfortably hold between 20% to 25% of the Treasury market, remaining the largest holder of Treasuries, until about 2025,” he said.That backdrop, combined with the prospect the government’s debt managers will cut note and bond auctions later this year as the economy rebounds, is helping to keep yields low despite the sharp pickup in growth and rising consumer prices. The Treasury’s net private borrowing of notes and bonds will fall next year to $1.99 trillion, from $2.75 trillion this year, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.The central bank’s holdings of Treasuries have been growing by $80 billion a month, and it’s also adding $40 billion in mortgage debt to its balance sheet. That’s left it on course to buy a total of $960 billion of Treasury notes and bonds in the secondary market this year after snapping up $2.18 trillion last year. Strategists at JPMorgan predict the Fed will buy $390 billion more in 2022 before wrapping up its purchases.The minutes of the FOMC meeting reported that “a number of participants suggested that if the economy continued to make rapid progress toward the Committee’s goals, it might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchases.”The prospect of a such a slowdown has sown some consternation. The 10-year Treasury yield rose to the day’s high after the minutes, reaching 1.69% as traders boosted bets on the outlook for Fed rate hikes.But the yield is still just a little more than half the average of the past two decades, and some analysts are confident that Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues will take a cautious approach to winding down quantitative easing.“The Powell Fed is skittish about touching any aspect of its balance sheet, which is why it’ll be slow to slow asset purchases and will never sell securities outright on the back end of QE,” said former Fed official and Mellon chief economist Vincent Reinhart.Peter Yi, head of taxable credit research at Northern Trust Asset Management, thinks there’s limited upside to long-term Treasury yields. He expects the 10-year yield to swing between 1.25% and 1.75% through the rest of 2021 and has been buying when yields back up. Percolating inflation, with U.S. consumer prices climbing in April by the most since 2009, will prove temporary, he added.“The Fed has tools in their toolkit that they are going to use if they absolutely need to do it to prevent 10-year yields from jumping dramatically and in a disorderly way,” Yi said.The last time the Fed began to pull back from asset purchases was from January through October 2014, when it unwound the quantitative easing measures ushered in after the 2008 credit crisis. While Treasury yields rose in 2013 in anticipation of that, the effects were muted, with yields falling in 2014.The Fed was in no rush to unload its bond holdings, however, and kept rolling them into new securities when they matured. In October 2017, the bank began to whittle down its portfolio, only to stop abruptly in September 2019 when it caused mayhem in the overnight lending market.Dan Krieter, a strategist in BMO Capital Markets’ fixed-income strategy group, doesn’t see the Fed shrinking its balance sheet for years.“It’s becoming harder and harder for the Fed to ever extricate itself from the financial system,” Krieter said. “At least for the next five or so years, the Fed isn’t even going to hint at the idea of reducing its balance sheet.”More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.2h agoCoinDeskRisk-Off: Sour Sentiment on Wall Street May Have Added to Bitcoin’s PlungeStocks drop on lingering inflation scare.

He said AI can shape the future and direction of the country. ""India clearly has the potential to become the AI capital of the world. The reason I say this is not just because I am here in India and I love India and so on. We are in a sweet spot where we have talent and a kind of complexity that only AI can solve,"" Chandrasekaran said while speaking at RAISE Summit. He said if India is able to solve the problems using AI, then the solutions can spread to developing as well as developed nations. ""For the coming decade to be India's decade, to my mind there are two challenges. On the one hand, solving the access challenge to make every service like healthcare, education available to every citizen irrespective of the place where they live..."" Chandrasekaran said. The other challenge is to provide meaningful and productive futuristic jobs for the vast population of India, he added. ""Right now the global digital economy is in fact headed towards a splintered future. That will limit the scalability and potential of entire platform economics because of issues related to data governance. ""Solving for data governance, specifically what should be the global standard for data residency -- localisation, privacy and security -- are very important steps for our long term success. I think developing a policy framework will accelerate development of AI and AI based solutions in a significant way,"" Chandrasekaran said. He said AI and AI-based solutions, tools and technologies should not be put to use for the elite and instead should be used for the common man. ""This means our vision should not be centred around software professionals and data scientists and other white collar workers. But our vision should include farmers, truck drivers, shopkeepers, teachers and everyone else,"" Chandrasekaran said. The government is looking to use AI for various applications including resolving language barriers that people of the country face while communicating, enhancing agriculture productivity, among others. The National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence (NSAI) had highlighted that the potential of AI in boosting India's annual growth rate by 1.3 percentage points by 2035 and identified priority sectors for deployment of AI with government's support. Chandrasekaran said, ""As the world's largest democracy and as a place where data is getting created at such a high volume and where there are many problems, all of which can be solved through AI, I really think India should seize the opportunity to lead this globally. We should not lose the momentum, but we should quickly get into execution.

The Bosch SoundSee technology was launched to the International Space Station (ISS) in late 2019 and is currently being used aboard the station to assess system operations.L-R: Joseph Aracri, DO, AHN pediatrician and Chair of its Pediatric Institute; Kelly J. Shields, PhD, Senior Research Data Scientist, Highmark Health; and Dr. Samarjit Das, leader of the Intelligent Internet of Things group at Bosch Research in Pittsburgh showcase the innovative sensor technology that will be used as part of the research collaboration between Highmark Health and Bosch.The new research collaboration builds upon a long-time practice in doctor-patient care. When doctors put a stethoscope on a patient's chest, they can hear audio patterns that help them detect an abnormality. Highmark Health and Bosch are applying the same principles of the stethoscope by using AI-enabled sensor technology to listen and detect audio cues that could help with patient diagnosis. Such AI capabilities have the potential to improve patient-centric, at-home care where audio AI-based diagnostic results can be reported to a doctor for further analysis and recommended action.By using high-fidelity microphones coupled with AI and machine learning for sound analysis, the research team will investigate if pediatric pulmonary conditions such as asthma can be detected using the noise emitted through various breathing patterns from patients.Clinical studies will be conducted through the Pediatric Institute of Allegheny Health Network (AHN) and are scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2022. Joseph Aracri, DO, AHN pediatrician and Chair of its Pediatric Institute will conduct the first feasibility study in a small cohort of pediatric patients. During the patient's visit to the pediatric clinic, the high-resolution microphone will be used to capture the sounds as the children speak and breathe. The sounds will then be processed and added as a feature into the AI and machine learning techniques along with clinically relevant information and the child's diagnosis.""This unique collaboration between two industry leaders fits squarely with our mission of exploring technological innovations that can improve the health and wellness of our patients and members,"" said Kelly J. Shields, PhD, Senior Research Data Scientist, Highmark Health. ""Bosch's global leadership in the development of pioneering industrial and consumer technologies and Highmark Health's R&D expertise, along with AHN's leading pediatric expertise is an incredibly promising combination that we believe can help transform the diagnosis and treatment of asthma and other breathing disorders.""Dr. Aracri has practiced medicine as part of AHN Pediatrics since 1998 and served as its president from 2009 through 2014. Since 2014, Dr. Aracri has also served as the Chair of the Department of Pediatrics for Allegheny Health Network, leading a Department of Pediatrics with more than 120 affiliated physicians, providing a broad range of inpatient and outpatient care, including general pediatrics, asthma, allergy and immunology, and neonatology services. In western Pennsylvania alone, over 60 providers within AHN Pediatrics provide care for over 80,000 pediatric patients at 20 locations. The lifetime asthma rate in Pennsylvania was 12.3% in 2019 among children in the 0–17-year age range.Audio AI expands from space to earth Bosch's SoundSee technology on-board the Space Station connects to NASA's free-flying Astrobee robot and performs AI-driven analytics on audio data from the station's systems and equipment to develop fully autonomous sensing capabilities to gauge system performance and predict maintenance needs. The technology captures ambient noise through built-in microphones and then uses artificial intelligence to extract operational characteristics of the machines and components from their emitted audio patterns to spot potential anomalies.""It has always been the vision of Bosch that the SoundSee technology would have applications beyond space,"" said Dr. Samarjit Das, leader of the Intelligent Internet of Things group at Bosch Research in Pittsburgh. ""Our new research collaboration with Highmark Health and Allegheny Health Network is another important step in demonstrating the potential of this technology – and specifically artificial intelligence – to provide benefit to humankind.""Bosch has secured multiple patents in utilizing the SoundSee AI technology towards various consumer and industrial applications such as environmental audio event recognition and machine health monitoring.Sensors help to detect asthmaAlready Bosch's experience and core competencies in sensor and microsystems technology, miniaturization, algorithm development and smart connectivity have yielded a product for monitoring asthma. The Vivatmo me enables asthmatics to monitor their condition at home via a breath-gas analyzer device that allows patients to accurately determine levels of inflammation and document them in an app that can be shared with their doctor. Vivatmo me has been available in Germany and Austria since March 2020 and Bosch plans to obtain approval in other markets, such as the United States.About Highmark Health: Highmark Health, a Pittsburgh, PA-based enterprise that employs more than 37,000 people who serve millions of Americans across the country, is the parent company of Highmark Inc., Allegheny Health Network, and HM Health Solutions.

Musk says the goal of the robot is to replace humans where work is repetitive, boring or dangerous.Creating a humanoid robot to replace humans doing work isn’t a new concept, it's just never actually been done before. Science fiction first imagined robots to look something like the Tin Man from the Wizard of Oz. They could do everything humans could do but with stiff and jerky movements (like the Robot Dance).More:Online resources for international travelIn practice, “robots” we see today resemble very little from the natural world. They are more purpose designed and practical.Think about the Roomba — the vacuum robot. It is a small cynical robot that drives itself around a room on wheels. Visual and physical sensors help it map out the room and avoid obstacles, like falling down stairs. It is a great design for vacuuming, but would be rather useless for other jobs.The list of purpose-built robots goes on from bomb defusal to hamburger flippers. This contrast has got me thinking about what a “robot” is. Musk claims the reason Tesla, an auto manufacturer, is building a robot is Tesla has a core expertise in artificial intelligence.Tesla cars have a lot of AI built into themAfter all, Tesla cars have a lot of AI built into them (including some “self driving” features). Does that type of AI translate to the manual labor a humanoid robot would do? I don’t know. The problem I see is that the Telsa Bot’s job is very vaguely defined. How many “repetitive, boring or dangerous” jobs can you think of?Now list all the skills involved with those jobs. These would include such diverse things as packing boxes, cutting down trees, collecting environmental samples, mining, dog walking and manual data entry.Humans can do all of those things because our minds and limbs (especially hands) make us fairly dexterous in the jobs we can perform. It would make sense to create a humanoid robot to be able to do all of those things. Right? I am not convinced. I am also not convinced any of the things I listed as robots are actual “robots.”What is the line between being a simple machine and being a robot?Here is where things get scary/weird/exciting depending on your outlook on the future.Does a “robot” have to be self aware to be considered a robot? What is the line between being a simple machine and being a robot? Most of the use cases above, like bomb defusal and vacuum, feel more like tools than robots.They may be somewhat independent but they are still dependent on humans for input, direction, maintenance and purpose. And do they need “AI”? When does a machine go from using a bunch of data to create an answer to true artificial intelligence?The philosophical problem I begin to have with all of this is that most of those questions can be applied to ourselves as humans. Do you determine your own input and direction? Or do social factors such as family, friends and coworkers influence you? Can you maintain yourself or do you use the expertise of doctors, trainers, teachers, and advisors? Do you know what your purpose is?Can we program a robot to be independent?If we programmed a robot to believe it is independent, would it be able to distinguish between its programming and its true artificial intelligent self? Can you?This is a long way to get back around to asking about the goal of Musk and his humanoid robot. There will be machines that are better at mining, sample collecting and dog walking that will be more like the Roomba (that is not human looking) than the Tesla Bot.But maybe Elon Musk’s point isn’t to create something to solve physical problems we humans have. Maybe it is to challenge our very own identity. I don’t know. But I do know the smarter our machines become the more we will have to question some of our own fundamental assumptions about ourselves.View Comments Careers Staff Directory Accessibility Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Licensing & Reprints Help Center Subscriber Guide My Account My Print Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Facebook Twitter E-EditionJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Reviewed.com 10Best Reach Local USA TODAY Sports+© 2021 www.the-daily-record.com.

Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and his wife, Wendy, have given $150 million to a research institute to establish a “new era of biology” aimed at battling diseases with a mix of data and life science studies.The Massachusetts-based Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard will use the funds to build a new center that will bring together academia and industry to merge the two disciplines in an effort to make people healthier.“Until now, these fields have largely developed in parallel,” the Broad Institute said in a statement on Thursday. “Their convergence will create a new era of biology, one that is expected to yield a deep understanding of biological processes, with the ultimate aim of improving human health through more powerful disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.”Experts say the initiative sets a precedent for building more research centers that mix the two disciplines.

“There is a huge need in the biology field to bring in computational and data science expertise,” said Peng Qiu, a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology who studies the subject, adding, the need for integrating the two fields “has been well recognized in the research community.” The endowment gift is the largest donation the couple has given through Schmidt Futures, their latest philanthropic initiative focusing on science and technology. The Schmidts have other philanthropic arms, including their family foundation, and are ranked as one of the top donors in the United States.The institute said Thursday that it also received an additional $150 million contribution from the Broad Foundation, the charity founded by philanthropists Eli and Edythe L. Broad. The couple helped create the institute in 2003, and their foundation has pledged more than $1 billion to the research facility.“Much like Eli and Edye Broad saw the potential in creating the Broad Institute, Wendy and I believe this center has the promise to create a new field of science that could benefit human health in ways we can’t even begin to imagine,” Eric Schmidt, a member of the institute’s board, said in the announcement.

“The pandemic has shown us that prioritizing science, innovation, and research is one of the greatest investments we can make in our future,” he added.The center, which will be named after the Schmidts, will collaborate with experts from numerous fields at companies ranging from Google, Microsoft and AstraZeneca, and learning institutions including Oxford University and the Mayo Clinic.“Philanthropic gifts of this magnitude have the potential to be transformative in scientific discovery,” said R. Patrick Bixler, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin’s RGK Center for Philanthropy and Community Service. He notes doing this work “through a network of cross-sector partners will undoubtedly lead to breakthroughs in internal medicine and public health.”Schmidt served as Google’s CEO from 2001 to 2011, a time of rapid growth for the California-based technology company. He later became executive chairman for Google, and in 2015, for its new parent company, Alphabet, before resigning as chairman in 2018.

(Image: AFP)  Several million devotees are thronging the ghats in Uttarakhand's Haridwar to take dips in the Ganges during the ongoing Maha Kumbh congregation amid the deadly second COVID-19 wave sweeping the country.While officials have admitted that they are struggling to impose safety protocols at such a big gathering, the Uttarakhand police have hired a Noida-based ‘examination security solutions’ firm to manage crowds as videos and pictures of pilgrims, squeezed shoulder-to-shoulder on the river banks jostling for a dip, emerge in utter disregard of social distancing norms.Moneycontrol spoke with officials from the Uttarakhand Police and the Noida-based company to know how the Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based security tools have been used at the Kumbh.The CompanyThe AI-based facial recognition system, approved last year, was earlier supposed to be handled by the Hewlett Packard Enterprise, on the lines of an earlier project, the Dehradun Smart City Limited (DSCL).Close    COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions   View more        How does a vaccine work?  A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.    How many types of vaccines are there?  There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.    What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind?  Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.

Its list of customers—preceding the Uttarakhand Police—are Delhi Police, Chandigarh Police, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), and Staff Selection Committee (SSC)-Delhi, among other examination conducting agencies.Said Avdhesh Sharma, project manager at Kumbh, Innovatiview: “We deal with all security-related equipment. Our major projects include Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC) and Union Public Service Commission (UPSC)/SSC examination centres, among others. We also handle the CCTVs installed in Delhi on January 26 and August 15. Recently, we were also involved in surveillance in red zone areas during COVID-19 in Delhi.”CWC is a central government-owned warehouse storage and handling service provider.The TechnologyThe AI-based police surveillance system that functions out of a control room set up at the mela venue, consists of 310 CCTV cameras, 50 internet protocol-based public address systems and five variable message display (VMD) boards, apart from the computers.Of the 310 cameras, 278 that are fixed are equipped with ‘varifocal’ lenses with zoom in and zoom out options. Another 22 cameras are PTZ (pan tilt zoom) that can be moved in different directions while the remaining 10 are enabled with automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) system for vehicles.The system is connected to I2V- an integrated video security software with video management system (VMS), built-in video analytics and options to integrate third-party devices.Facial recognition works on context. Broadly, facial recognition is deployed for three uses. One, to establish an identity. Example: phones, that use facial recognition to unlock the home screen. The camera scans your face, turns it into biometric data and compares it to information it has stored. The same technology is also used by airports for automated checks. Two, to spot people in crowds. Here, facial recognition is used to scan groups of people and zero in on individuals. Three, to track behaviour. Some classrooms in China use this to spot unusual behaviour in children; for example, if they are in distress.The facial recognition technology that is being put to use at the Kumbh is a method of identifying or verifying the identity of individuals using their faces captured real-time in the cameras.The process uses computer algorithms to verify distinctive details about an image of an individual’s face called the template. These details, for example the distance between the eyes of a person or the shape of his/her chin, are then converted into a mathematical representation to be compared with data on other faces in the database.“The whole analytics focuses on four major goals – ‘head count’, ‘object count’, ‘vehicle count’ and `identify people with no masks,” said Innovatiview’s Sharma.‘Head count’ is to keep a tab on the number of people allowed to gather at a particular place to avoid overcrowding at ghats vulnerable to stampede. ‘Object count’ is to keep a tab on the actual number of people entering and exiting a ghat for the bath, at a time. ‘Vehicle count’ is used to calculate the number of vehicles that are moving towards the ghats or are in the parking area using ANPR cameras. The cameras are also meant to spot unattended objects. The public address systems can reach out to a 70-km radius, said officials.“We followed the old, time-tested police methods for crowd and traffic management coupled with the latest AI technology. So, in a way it’s a blend of the two,” Sanjay Gunjyal, Inspector General (IG) mela, told Moneycontrol.The ImpactThe Kumbh Mela started on April 1 and Uttarakhand Chief Minister Tirath Singh Rawat inaugurated the surveillance control room on April 9.The mela sees a daily average of over three lakh devotees at various ghats, but the number swells up during the shahi snans (major baths) held on March 11, April 12, April 14 and the last one, which is scheduled on April 27. On April 12, the total number of pilgrims who took bath was 31 lakh and includes those who also showed up on April 11 as well. On April 14, as many as six lakh pilgrims arrived at Haridwar.We are glad to be one of the first companies to bring an AI based, high speed, and extremely accurate touchless biometric verification solution to India - InnovativiewIn 2010, about 16 million pilgrims had taken this holy dip, known as Baisakhi snan, officials said.  Devotees believe that bathing in the Ganga will cleanse them of their sins and bring salvation.Officials said that the AI technology was used primarily to avoid stampede-like situations across 107 ghats in the middle of the pandemic. Ashok Kumar, director general of police (DGP), Uttarakhand, told MoneyControl, that AI analytics did not come into play when things were running smoothly.“We used this to zoom on faces and vehicles and identify people who are not wearing masks,” he said.In pics | Rallies, religious gatherings aggravate India's worst COVID-19 surgeOn April 12, Kumar had told India Today that it was not possible to impose COVID-19 protocols in such huge crowds.Mukesh Thakur, assistant superintendent of police, Kumbh Mela, told Moneycontrol that the police used AI-enabled cameras to calculate that 21,34,000 pilgrims took bath on April 11, which came down to 9,98,000 on April 12.“Over all 31 lakh pilgrims were present at the ghats on these two days. We also noted 68,000 vehicles on April 12 at the venue,” he saidAs for identifying people without masks, Thakur said police avoided reaching out to pilgrims as it could have led to a stampede. Cops, however, distributed 1.10 lakh masks during the baths on April 11 and 12, he said.ControversyGlobally, the facial recognition system has its own up and downsides. A recently published BuzzFeed News investigation, ‘Surveillance Nation’, found that employees at law enforcement agencies across the United States ran thousands of Clearview AI facial recognition searches — often without the knowledge of the public or even their own departments.Noted the Buzzfeed report: “For years, law enforcement agencies have experimented with facial recognition, a technology that promises to help identify people of interest by matching surveillance photos to known images — such as a headshot from a driver’s license or passport. But there are several barriers to its adoption, including high costs, unreliable results, and public opposition.”In India too, the emerging AI technology for policing has faced opposition, with a growing chorus of critics demanding regulations. The Internet Freedom Foundation, a non-profit organisation that defends online freedom, privacy and innovation, says in its tracker that authorities have so far installed at least 48 facial recognition systems across the country.“We do not support use of any facial recognition technology for crowd management unless there is a threat of a law and order situation,” Anushka Jain, associate counsel (Transparency and Right to Information) | Internet Freedom Foundation, told MoneyControl. Well, law enforcement agencies deployed at the Kumbh fair are hardly going to take such a generous view.

Machine learning and eco-consciousness key business trends in 2020


By Fabian Calle.
Published at Jan 24, 2020, in Ctrl Alt Del


In 2020, small to medium sized businesses (SMBs) are likely to focus more on supporting workers to travel and collaborate in ways that suit them, while still facing a clear economic imperative to keep costs under control.
This will likely involve increased use of technologies such as machine learning and automation to: help determine and enforce spending policies; ensure people travelling for work can optimise, track, and analyse their spend; and prioritise travel options that meet goals around environmental responsibility and sustainability.
Businesses that recognise and respond to these trends will be better-placed to save money while improving employee engagement and performance, according to SAP Concur.
Fabian Calle, General Manager, Small to Medium Business, ANZ, SAP Concur, said, “As the new decade begins, the business environment will be subject to the same economic ups and downs seen in the previous decade. However, with new technologies and approaches, most businesses will be able to leverage automation and even artificial intelligence to smooth out those peaks and troughs.”
SAP Concur has identified the top five 2020 predictions for SMBs, covering economics, technology, business, travel, the environment, diversity, and corporate social responsibility:Small businesses will tighten budgets to safeguard against economic and government downturns Small businesses tend to be the most significantly affected by economic fluctuations because of their typically lean operating models. With the local economy likely to be affected by ongoing uncertainty from factors such as the US-China trade war, and a possible hard landing for China, small businesses need to make sure spending is tightly controlled during 2020.Machine learning moves from a novelty to a routine functionBusinesses have been fascinated by the novelty and promise of machine learning (ML) and this will become the norm in 2020, as ML proliferates throughout business operations. Using ML, automated systems will increasingly anticipate business needs, whether they be related to expense reports, scheduling, or other processes. It will do all or a portion of certain tasks, with more accuracy and speed than a human being. SAP Concur is working on advances in these areas such as pre-filling travel itineraries and predicting the location of expenses based on previous trips. ML therefore eliminates mundane operational duties, allowing employees to put more energy towards creative and productive work.A move toward office spaces that offer co-location with a purposeStatic workplaces and limited recruiting policies are issues of the past given increasing use of smart collaboration and engagement tools. Mobile-first nomadism is enhancing the way SMBs function, with virtual meetings becoming as common as in-person ones. Employees feel less tethered to a traditional office and want the ability to work from anywhere. In 2020, these developments will lead to noticeable changes in office spaces, creating a new approach known as co-location with a purpose. There will be a shift towards flexible office spaces: open-space hubs to host teams; touch-down spaces for those usually working from alternate bases; plentiful conference rooms for more collaborative work; and easily available focus rooms for those who need an occasional alternative to open spaces.Environmental concerns will accelerate eco-conscious travelA recent study by Wakefield research found that one-third of business travellers have adjusted their form of travel due to environmental concerns, and SAP Concur predicts that number will rise. With airlines adjusting seating options to maximise travellers per flight, and hotels rethinking the sustainability of their designs, it’s only the beginning of a shift to eco-friendly travel. As discussions around climate change intensify, companies and employees will continue to strive for more sustainable travelling options.2020 will be the year of the purpose-driven workplaceMillennials are projected to make up half of all workers in 2020, giving rise to purpose-driven workplaces. Organisations will adjust their missions to more clearly demonstrate the business’s societal, environmental, and nonprofit impact as they look to connect to a purpose beyond profit. Purpose-driven workplaces tend to deliver better financial performance through attracting and retaining top talent and increasing engagement and productivity among current employees.Calle said, “2020 will continue to drive significant developments as organisations of all sizes look to optimise efficiency and productivity through employee operations and satisfaction. Australian businesses need to be aware of these trends and adopt cutting edge technology to facilitate their workers’ need to travel and collaborate more effectively and with less effort.”

ChatGPT has the potential to change the world in many ways, impacting jobs and transforming industries. Its ability to understand and generate human language could be used to improve the capabilities of a wide range of AI-powered systems, including virtual assistants, chatbots, and other types of natural language interfaces. This could make it easier for businesses to interact with customers and for individuals to access information.In different fields such as customer service, content creation, search, information retrieval and education, ChatGPT is set to transform the world. While it’s important to note that the model is still new and that there are ethical and societal implications that need to be considered, the potential benefits of ChatGPT are hard to ignore. Google, Meta, Amazon, several start-ups are taking on this ‘open AI + Microsoft’ combine. It is not going to be an uncontested road ahead. Is this change truly shape shifting and immutable? Is it merely evolution with more fizz? What lessons can be learned from brand building of innovations?It is a proven fact that great ideas die in labs and proving grounds because a viable means to commercialise them does not emerge. When the lucky few do make it to the marketplace, getting awareness and due consideration is a steep hill to climb. Then there is the need to be able to present a product with due context. It is like looking into a mirror. Too close and you can’t see the full picture and too far away, you cannot see clearly enough. In a similar way, market immersion needs to be optimised and done iteratively. Innovations driven by a new technology, typically follow a multi phased marketing process.Also Read: What is ChatGPT and what makes it worth a possible $30 billion?As soon as a new technology emerges, it is initially used by experts and technology enthusiasts. As it begins to spread, new companies most open to innovation in marketing come into the market. At this time the majority adoption has also occurred. The earlier technology now begins to be commonly used. A stage is again set for innovation. This cycle repeats itself with shorter and shorter time frames.Three ‘laws’ can explain this new world. The first is the 'Moore’s Law' of exponential growth and ever lower costs of computer power. The second is ‘Metcalfe’s Law’ about the value of networks, which grows disproportionally to accretion in size, and the third ‘Gilder’s Law’ is that the total bandwidth of communication systems triples every twelve months.The business model of the mechanical age (and the first phases of the electronic age) was based on the creation of efficiency through economies of scale in production and economies of scope in distribution. In the Internet age, markets have been addressed in a state of fragmentation into various segments and niches. Customer networks emerged and its members influenced each other’s choices reciprocally. Traditional one-way communication—inform, persuade, and convince to buy - has been replaced with nuanced approaches where consumers themselves decide the main influencer.In my opinion, the growth of artificial intelligence-driven algorithms and predictive analytics have heightened the need for more expertise and ‘true to domain’ marketing rather than lessen it. Marketing is deliberately cramped in most ‘routine’ decision making. Sales metrics are often used to evaluate brand building. The reverse is often ignored. In other words, brand health surge, a lead variable, may get ignored when compared to a surging sales performance which may well be on the back of promotions and tactics that in fact damage the brand. The search, content, and loyalty campaigns that get called marketing are mostly only shallow tactics. True brand magic is up the value chain - in ideas, insights, product origination or indeed, creating markets. Any cheaper alternative can be found for boring copy or visual rendition. You hardly need ChatGPT.Understanding people’s fundamental needs and drivers, identifying customers, and developing the entire go-to-market and usage ecosystem decide the success of innovations, especially breakthrough ones. Marketers need to be included in development discussions upstream in the innovation development process. Besides clearly defining who to sell the new offering to and how to sell it, such involvement helps in the following ways:Exploration of consumer needs and framing of insights - Marketing must probe deeper than the consumer has thought about the need. It must dive into the subconscious. Unstated needs are the best sources of value creating innovations.Creation of product or service appeal based on relevance and context - The context is about the cultural, social, and psychological levers that elevate an innovation to an instant or enduring hit.Walking in consumer shoes – Done via customer research and insight development, it bleeds into communications framing and marketing must ensure genuine consumer utility is obvious.Thinking of entire ecosystems - Innovations today rely on several partners and involves others outside organisational boundaries directly and indirectly. Going solo may often be detrimental to rapid brand establishment.The recent past has several examples – Blackberry, Electronic diary, Pager, Segway, Walkman, iPod, 3D printing, Blockchain, and Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality that succeeded, rose and then wasted the original scale of promise that was visualised or surrendered it to the next innovation or got cannibalised by offerings from their own companies.Every great brand has a distinct tone. It acquires a linkage to the brand throughout its development. No matter how the brand evolves or changes the tone doesn’t change.Such a tone is a brand metaphor. I recently concluded two sequential campaigns at Tata Motors. The campaigns are intended to showcase our state-of-the-art trucks, innovations, enhanced facets and features, digitalisation, profitability, fuel efficiency, safety, superior technology, connectivity, driver productivity and cabin comfort through entertaining, slice of life commercials. This storytelling is a first ever attempt to present deeply technical enablement via everyday incidents. The campaign builds on the positioning Tata Trucks, Desh Ke Trucks. Only Tata has the stature to claim this in India.Gerald Zaltman, in his book How Customers Think, discussed the example of Chevy trucks being ‘like a rock’. When American consumers made a connection between the idea of a Chevy truck and the idea of a rock, they attributed reliability and ruggedness. The phrase “like a rock” came from Bob Seger’s iconic song and for that reason also acquired a sensibility of its own.The Zaltman prescription may not be to contrive a metaphorical must have but to appreciate what that does. Metaphors serve as abstractions and cue a larger mental network of associations. This is exactly what brands ought to do as well.Think of it as the following parts:● Representational facets - How is it to be marketed – new, evolving or disruptive?● Essential value drivers - what builds irresistible value? What sustains it?● Touchpoints in consumer lives – central / peripheral?● Differentiation - How are you different from competitors?● Be Good to Do Well - How are you as a global citizen?Universal metaphors make sense across countries, cultures, languages, and dialects. By creating meaning, early adopters drop a bridge across the river they themselves have crossed at full flood so that the wider group of people can follow. The bigger the innovation, the bigger the risk of failure. Because consumer facing marketing can reduce those risks, it matters as much as innovation — perhaps even more.Also Read: Microsoft to add ChatGPT to Azure cloud services ‘soon’Check out our in-depth Market Coverage, Business News & get real-time Stock Market Updates on CNBC-TV18.
